<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I_The_Office_Boys_Peril" id="CHAPTER_I_The_Office_Boys_Peril">CHAPTER I.&mdash;The Office Boy's Peril.</a></h2>


<p>"Dick, come into my office," said Mr. Roger
Bacon, a well-known wholesale dealer in watches,
jewelry and silverware, on John street, New
York City.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Dick Darling, his fifteen-year-old
office boy&mdash;a bright, good-looking lad,
who had not yet graduated out of knickerbockers,
though most boys of his age would have dispensed
with them for trousers. Somehow or another
Dick looked to unusual advantage in knickerbockers,
and he made a pretty figure in the
store, which naturally made his employer partial
to that kind of attire in him. That was one reason
why he continued to wear them at his age.</p>

<p>Another reason was because being the youngest
of a family of four, the older members being
all girls, he was regarded by his mother and sisters
as the baby of the family, and they wouldn't
hear to his making any change in his attire. He
was only a baby in name, however, for there
wasn't a pluckier young chap of his years in his
neighborhood, or in the city for that matter.
The boys in his block, who knew him well, and
those employed in the vicinity of Mr. Bacon's
store, downtown, often made his knickerbockers
the butt of their witticism, but Dick was a self-reliant,
independent youth, and he didn't care a
rap for the fun and criticism that was directed
at his apparel. He surprised the downtown lads
by polishing off a couple of them who got too
gay on the subject, which made the rest rather
shy about tackling him, since it was apparent
that he knew how to use his fists if forced to call
upon them. When Dick followed his employer
into his private office the merchant pointed at
the chair beside the desk, so the office boy sat
down and awaited developments.</p>

<p>"Dick," said Mr. Bacon, "I'm going to send you
on an unusual mission. I want you to take this
package," laying his hand on a square one which
stood on his desk, "to Springville, New Jersey.
The village is about an hour's ride from Jersey
City, on the line of the Central Railroad of
New Jersey. A train that will stop there leaves
Jersey City at four-thirty, and you have thirty
minutes to catch it. You will deliver the package
at the home of Mr. Goodrich&mdash;his name and address
are written on the outside. As he is well
known in the place, the station agent or anybody
in the village will direct you to his house, which
I believe is not over ten minutes' walk from the
station. Under ordinary circumstances this package
would be sent by express, but the order came
only a short time ago, and the article must reach
the gentleman early this evening. I may as well
tell you that it is a wedding present, and is worth
about $330. You ought to be able to deliver the
package and get back to the station in time to
take the train for Jersey City which stops at
Springville at six-fifteen. That is all. Go to the
cashier and he will hand you money enough to
cover all your expenses."</p>

<p>Dick took the package and carried it with him
into the counting room, where the cashier handed
him a five-dollar bill and told him to turn in the
change in the morning. Then he put on his hat
and started for the Cortlandt street ferry. He
landed in Jersey City in ample time to catch the
accommodation train which stopped at all points
north of its destination. Dick enjoyed the ride to
Springville, where he arrived about half-past five.</p>

<p>He found no trouble in reaching the Goodrich
house, where he asked for Mr. Goodrich and delivered
the package to him. The gentleman presented
him with a dollar, treated him to some
cake and lemonade, after which Dick started back
for the station. He arrived there five minutes
before train time and went to the window to buy
a return ticket. The agent was busy at the telegraph
key and Dick had to wait for him to get
through.</p>

<p>"I want a ticket for Jersey City," said the office
boy.</p>

<p>"Sorry, but there's just been an accident down
the road. The train you expect to take, due here
in five minutes, ran into a number of freight cars
on a siding, owing to a switch having been imperfectly
locked, and it stuck there. It may be
hours before the tangle is straightened out. You
will have to wait for the nine-ten, which is the
next train that stops here."</p>

<p>"Nine-ten!" exclaimed Dick. "That's three
hours from now."</p>

<p>The agent nodded.</p>

<p>"This is only a small place, and but few of
the trains stop here," he said.</p>

<p>"If I have to wait for that train I won't get
home till after eleven o'clock, and my folks
will be worried to death about me, for they don't
know that I was sent down here."</p>

<p>The agent looked at the clock.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you what you can do if you are
a spry walker. The express which passes here
at seven-thirty stops at Carlin, six miles north
of this station. There's a good road running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
straight to that town. If you think you can cover
the distance between now and seven-thirty-eight,
why, you will be able to get that train, which will
land you in Jersey City about eight-ten."</p>

<p>"I'll try it. Where's the road?"</p>

<p>The agent came out of his office, took Dick to
the rear door of the station, and showed him the
road.</p>

<p>"It goes right to Carlin, you say?" said Dick.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Will it land me near the station?"</p>

<p>"Within a short distance of it. You ought to
make the train, for you have an hour and twenty-five
minutes to do it in. You ought to be able
to walk five miles in an hour if you do your best.
It's a good hard road on which a person can
make good time."</p>

<p>Dick started at a brisk walk for Carlin. He
came to a fork in the road after going about a
mile. After due deliberation he took what he
thought was the right road, but which turned out
to be the wrong one. After he had walked what
he thought at least six miles and no town in
sight, he felt he had taken the wrong road. An
old and apparently deserted house stood near
where Dick halted and a storm coming up, he decided
to seek shelter there. It was now nearly
dark. Dick sought shelter in the old house. The
door was nearly off its hinges. Soon the storm
came on, and by a flash of lightning he saw a
couple of men each with a bag over his shoulder,
putting for the house. He drew back into what
had apparently been a bedroom, as he did not
wish to be seen by the strangers.</p>

<p>As soon as the two men entered, they started
to talk of dividing the contents of the bags as
soon as they reached the house of one of the
men, who was called Parker by the other, whose
name was Bulger. Dick soon learned the bag
contained the contents of a burglary which the
two men had committed on a large house in the
vicinity, and that they had had an exciting encounter
with one of the servants. Dick felt that
he was in bad company. In leaning a little too
heavily on one foot a board creaked, which sound
the two thieves heard, and they started to investigate.
Dick retreated into a corner of the room.
One of the thieves heard him and made a dive
for the spot. As Dick could not see the crook
any better than that individual could see him, he
was taken by surprise when the muscular arms of
the man suddenly encountered him and he was
immediately seized and dragged out of the corner.
The crook saw that it was a boy he had hold of.</p>

<p>"Now, you young imp, I've got you!" he cried
triumphantly. "What are you hidin' up in this
place for?"</p>

<p>"What's that to you?" replied Dick pluckily.</p>

<p>"Sassy, are you? I reckon I'll take some of
the sass out'r you before I'm through with you.
Come along."</p>

<p>He dragged the boy into the next room.</p>

<p>"Open the winder and let's take a squint at
this chap," said Bulger.</p>

<p>Parker threw up the dirty window overlooking
the road, but the amount of light that came in
did not greatly help matters out.</p>

<p>"How came you in this house?" said Bulger.</p>

<p>"I came here to get out of the storm," replied
Dick.</p>

<p>"Oh, you did; then why didn't you show yourself
when we came in?"</p>

<p>"Why should I?"</p>

<p>"You heard us come in, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you didn't let on you were here. You've
been listenin' to our talk."</p>

<p>Dick made no reply.</p>

<p>"You heard all we said, didn't you?" said Bulger,
giving the boy a rough shake.</p>

<p>"You say I did."</p>

<p>"I know you did."</p>

<p>"Then what's the use of asking me, if you know
so much?"</p>

<p>"Because I want you to admit it."</p>

<p>"I'll admit nothing."</p>

<p>"I'll choke the life out of you if you don't!"
said the crook savagely.</p>

<p>"I haven't done you any harm, what do you
want to treat me this way for?"</p>

<p>"But you intend to squeal on us as soon as you
get away."</p>

<p>"What will I squeal about?"</p>

<p>"About what you heard."</p>

<p>"I haven't said that I heard anything."</p>

<p>"Who are you, anyway?" said Bulger, suddenly
changing his line of questioning.</p>

<p>"My name is Dick Darling."</p>

<p>"Where do you live around here?"</p>

<p>"I don't live around here at all."</p>

<p>"You don't? Know anybody named Darling
about here, Parker?"</p>

<p>"No. He looks like a stranger to me as well
as I can see him," said Parker.</p>

<p>"Where do you live, then?" demanded Bulger.</p>

<p>"In New York."</p>

<p>"New York!" roared the crook. "What are
you givin' me?"</p>

<p>"That's the truth."</p>

<p>"What are you doin' 'way down here in Jersey,
then? Who are you visitin'?"</p>

<p>"Nobody. I was sent to Springville on an errand
by my boss."</p>

<p>"Where's Springville, Parker?"</p>

<p>"It's a village on the railroad about eight miles
from here."</p>

<p>"If you were sent to Springville, how is it that
you are over here?"</p>

<p>"An accident happened to the train I was going
to take for Jersey City, and the agent told me
that I could catch an express if I walked to Carlin.
That's what brought me over here."</p>

<p>"Did you start to walk to Carlin from Springville?"
asked Parker.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Dick.</p>

<p>"And instead of keepin' to your left, you turned
into the road to the right and came over here,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did that. And I walked away from the
town instead of toward it?"</p>

<p>"That's what you've been doin'."</p>

<p>"That's tough. I'll have to go back to the Carlin
road, then, before I'm on the right track
again."</p>

<p>"I reckon you won't go nowheres at present,"
said Bulger. "You've heard too much for some
people's good. We'll take him over to your
place, Parker, and hold on to him till I'm ready
to dig out, and then I'll take him with me."</p>

<p>Having decided that point, the crook took a
firm hold of the boy by the arm, and led him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
outside, followed by his pal, who shouldered the
two bags.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II_Dick_Escapes" id="CHAPTER_II_Dick_Escapes">CHAPTER II.&mdash;Dick Escapes.</a></h2>


<p>Dick was marched along the road to a field,
lifted over the fence, and compelled to tramp it
through the sodden turf and high grass. At
length they reached another fence and he was
lifted over that, too. The grass wasn't so tall in
this meadow, but it was high enough to keep his
shoes and stockings well soaked. They passed
downhill here into a wood, and through the wood
to another meadow, and across the meadow to a
road, a narrow branch one, and along the road to
a small weather-beaten picket gate, in the center
of a picket fence, which admitted them to a ruinous-looking
plot of ground, in the foreground of
which stood a disreputable-looking two-story
house, with a light shining from one of the windows.
Dick was marched around the house to a
crazy barn in the rear. The door, held by a
hasp and staple, was opened and he was pushed
in, followed by the man, Parker dropping the
bags on the floor. Parker fumbled about on a
beam till he found a match, with which he lighted
a lantern. Then he got a piece of rope and
with it Dick was bound to a post on which some
odd pieces of harness were hanging. The men
then conferred in a low tone. Finally, after Bulger
had examined Dick's bonds to make sure that
he was well tied, the men took the bags up and
left the barn, after blowing out the light, and
secured the door after them.</p>

<p>For the next half hour Dick worked hard to
get free from the post. He twisted and pulled
and shoved his arms this way and that, stopping
occasionally to rest himself. Perseverance, they
say, will conquer in the end; at any rate, it did
in Dick's case, for at the end of thirty minutes
he pulled one of his hands out of the bonds. The
other soon followed, but still he wasn't free, for
the rope around his chest held him close to the
post. Even though his hands were free, he could
not reach the knot that held him a prisoner. However,
that did not greatly matter, for he managed
to work his right arm to the front so he could put
his hand in his pocket and pull out his knife.
He had to put it behind his back to open it, but
once that was done all he had to do was to crook
his arm and begin sawing at the rope. The blade
was sharp so the strands were quickly severed,
and he stepped away from the post, free at last.
The next thing was to get out of the barn. He
tried the door, but that was beyond him. Then
he felt his way around the walls in the dark,
stumbling over various obstacles in his path. He
found a place at the back where the boards appeared
to be loose. He struck at one with his
heel and it began to give way. Encouraged by
this, he kept at it and in a short time detached
the end of the board. He succeeded in knocking
out a second board, and ripping both off, made a
hole sufficiently large for him to crawl through.
He knew where the road was and he started for
it, taking care to give the house a wide berth.</p>

<p>There was a light in the room he judged was
the kitchen, and he believed the two men were
there, drying their clothes. He climbed over the
picket fence, and when he stood in the road the
problem of where it led to struck him with some
force. He would have to follow the road in one
direction or the other, and he had no idea at all
where he would fetch up at. The night was dark
and the strangeness and uncertainty of his situation
made him feel all at sea. He started down
the road at random, hoping he would meet with
a house where, if the inmates were up, he could
get information that would enable him to reach
Carlin. He saw the lighted windows of a house
up the road and decided to go there and make his
inquiries. As he approached the gate he saw
three men standing there talking. Two of them
seemed to be rural policemen. They looked at
him as he came up.</p>

<p>"Is this the road that runs into the Carlin
road?" he asked the party generally.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the well-dressed third person,
who was evidently connected with the house.</p>

<p>"Would you favor me with the time?"</p>

<p>"It is about ten o'clock."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir; now maybe you'll tell me
whether this house was robbed this evening just
before the thunderstorm?"</p>

<p>The three looked at Dick with some surprise
and curiosity.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was," replied the gentleman. "How
did you learn about it?"</p>

<p>"From the two thieves themselves."</p>

<p>His reply created something of a sensation.</p>

<p>"You learned the fact from the thieves?" said
the gentleman.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Pray, who are you, young man? You seem to
be a stranger in this vicinity."</p>

<p>"I am a stranger. My name is Dick Darling.
I live in New York, and am employed by Roger
Bacon, wholesale dealer in watches, jewelry and
silverware. I was sent with a package to Mr.
Goodrich, of Springville, a few miles from here,
this afternoon, but after delivering it I found
that the accommodation train for Jersey City,
which stops at Springville at six-fifteen, had met
with an accident which put it out of business,
and being anxious to get home, the agent told
me that if I walked to Carlin, six miles north, I
could catch the next express, which stopped there
at seven-thirty-eight. I started to walk, and got
on all right till I came to where the road joined
another, this one, in fact. I took this one by
mistake and it brought me out here, away from
Carlin, though I did not know at the time that I
was going wrong. Then the thunderstorm came
on and I took refuge in the vacant house up
yonder."</p>

<p>Dick then went on to describe the arrival of the
two rough characters with a bag each, and how
not liking their looks he retreated to another
room, from which spot he overheard them speaking
about the robbery they had committed, and
what their plans were for the immediate future.
Then he told how they discovered his presence in
the house and made a prisoner of him, and after
questioning him closely they took him over to
the house where the man named Parker lived,
where they locked him up in the barn, after tying
him to a post to make sure he wouldn't get
away; but he had made his escape in spite of
their precautions, and found his way over to that
road, his object being to reach Carlin and, after
reporting the robbery and all the facts connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
with it, take the first train he could get for home.
Dick's story interested the gentleman, whose
name was Mason. They said they would go and
arrest the thieves, while Dick was to stay at Mason's
house until they came back. This plan was
carried out.</p>

<p>The gentleman took Dick into the house by a
side door and up a back stairs to his own room.
Here he provided the boy with a pair of long
stockings and his own slippers. Then he showed
him where he could wash his hands and face and
brush his hair. While Dick was thus employed,
his host took his shoes and stockings down to
the kitchen, and instructed the cook to start up
the fire and dry them as soon as possible. He returned
to his room and found that Dick had
made a great improvement in his personal appearance.</p>

<p>"Now we will go into the sitting room, and I
will make you acquainted with my family," he
said. "They are greatly exercised over the robbery,
for the thieves made a clean sweep of this
floor, and took all the jewelry and other personal
belongings of value, including a much-prized set
of silverware which my wife inherited from her
mother. The loss of the latter has made her
quite ill, but when I tell her that we are likely to
recover all our property through the information
furnished by you, it will make her feel much
better, and you will receive her thanks."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mason, her unmarried sister, and Miss
Madge were seated in a bunch in the sitting room,
looking very much dejected.</p>

<p>"Let me make you acquainted with Richard
Darling, of New York," said Mr. Mason.</p>

<p>Dick bowed and the ladies acknowledged the
introduction in a solemn way, expressive of the
state of their feelings.</p>

<p>"You will be glad to learn that this young man
has brought us a clue to the rascals who robbed
the house, and the constables have gone off quite
confident of capturing them and recovering our
property," said the gentleman.</p>

<p>His words produced a considerable change in
the ladies.</p>

<p>"Do you really think, John, that they will be
caught, and that we shall get our things back?"
asked his wife.</p>

<p>"I have strong hopes for it, for this lad's story
confirms William's statement that Samuel Parker
is one of the men. According to his account,
the two rascals went over to Parker's house,
where they proposed to hide the plunder in a dry
well on his grounds until it could be safely taken
away and disposed of."</p>

<p>Mr. Mason asked Dick to tell his story to the
ladies, and he did so. They expressed their astonishment
that circumstances should have
brought him into the business, and declared that
he was a fine, plucky boy. They said they were
sorry that his mother and sisters would necessarily
be worried about him, but he was sure to
get home early in the morning, probably about
half-past two, and then their anxiety would be
allayed.</p>

<p>"In the meanwhile we will try and make your
short stay with us as pleasant as possible," said
Mr. Mason, "and I assure you that you are entitled
to our grateful appreciation. We won't
forget what we owe you for the clue you have
furnished us, even if those rascals are not caught
as soon as we expect. And now as you have
missed your dinner, I will see that a meal is prepared
for you at once."</p>

<p>The gentleman left the room and the ladies
continued conversing with Dick. He was such a
nice, polite boy, and gentle in his ways, as lads
brought up in a family of girls usually are, that
they took a great fancy to him. After a while
Mr. Mason returned and told him to accompany
him downstairs. Dick found a nice meal waiting
for him, and as he was very hungry, he did full
justice to it. While he was eating, the constables
returned, bringing their prisoners with them and
also the stolen goods. The ladies were pleased
to death to learn that their property had been
recovered and, of course, gave all the credit for
it to Dick. After the office boy had finished eating
he was taken outside to identify the rascals,
which he did. The servant William also recognized
them as the thieves. Bulger favored Dick
with an unpleasant look and told him he hoped
to get even with him some day.</p>

<p>The rascals were then put in a wagon and carried
to the lock-up of the near-by village to be
removed next morning to Carlin. Mr. Mason had
his auto brought out of the garage.</p>

<p>"I am ready to take you to the station at Carlin,"
he said.</p>

<p>Dick was quite ready to go with him. He bade
the ladies and Miss Madge, who had taken a decided
liking to him, good-night, and he and his
host were presently en route for that town, which
they reached in ample time for Dick to connect
with the midnight express. Thirty minutes later
he reached Jersey City, crossed the river and took
an elevated train for Harlem. He reached the
flat where the family lived a few minutes before
two and found his mother and sisters all up and
in a great stew about him. He explained everything
to them, and then the family retired to
make the most of the few hours before morning
called them to arise as usual, for the girls all
worked in offices downtown and had to get away
about eight o'clock. Dick reached the store on
time next morning, in spite of the fact that his
usual hours of sleep had been curtailed, and he
turned the change of the $5 bill over to the
cashier; also the receipt Mr. Goodrich had signed
for the package. The office boy attended to his
duties until Mr. Bacon appeared about ten o'clock,
when he followed him into his office.</p>

<p>"You delivered the package to Mr. Goodrich
all right, I suppose?" said his employer.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I handed the receipt to the cashier."</p>

<p>Then Dick surprised Mr. Bacon with the story
of his adventures with the two thieves in New
Jersey.</p>

<p>"You didn't have much sleep," said Mr. Bacon.
"If you feel tired this afternoon you can go home
at four o'clock."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir, but I don't think that will be
necessary. I'll have plenty of time to make up
my lost rest by going to bed directly after supper.
Mr. Mason told me that I will be required
to appear in court at Carlin this afternoon when
the men are brought up before the magistrate.
He told me I should take the half-past twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
train down, and that he would meet me at the
station. Can I go?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. I have no right to prevent you giving
your testimony in court."</p>

<p>That ended the interview. Dick went to Carlin
that afternoon, was taken to the court by
Mason, and identified the men as the two thieves,
telling his story in a straightforward way. The
rascals were held for trial. Dick returned to New
York by an express, reaching Jersey City at half-past
five, and within an hour got home, just in
time to sit down to supper.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV_The_Missing_Diamond" id="CHAPTER_IV_The_Missing_Diamond">CHAPTER IV.&mdash;The Missing Diamond.</a></h2>


<p>Although Mr. Bacon was a wholesale dealer, he
also did a considerable retail trade as well. On
the following morning a well-dressed man came
into the store and asked to see some fine diamonds.
The clerk who waited on him showed
him a tray full of choice gems from two carats
up to five. The customer looked them over carefully,
made several selections, but the price was
always too high for him to pay. He tried to get
the clerk to reduce the figure, but that was out
of the question, as Mr. Bacon had but one price
for his goods. Finally the man said that he
would have to go elsewhere. As he started to
leave the sharp-eyed clerk noticed that a five-carat
stone was missing from the tray.</p>

<p>"One minute, sir," said the clerk. "You forgot
to return one of the diamonds you were looking
at."</p>

<p>"I did? Nonsense! Do you take me for a
thief? I only handled one of them at a time
and after looking it over laid it down on the
showcase, or on that mat."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, one of the diamonds is missing,"
said the clerk, pushing a button under the counter
which summoned the manager of the store.
The customer waxed indignant and protested that
he had no knowledge whatever of the diamond.
The clerk insisted that he must have it.</p>

<p>"Well, then, you can search me, but I think it's
an outrage," said the man.</p>

<p>The manager took him into his office and went
through all his pockets, and looked him over for
a secret pocket, but there was none and the diamond
was not found on him.</p>

<p>"You see, I haven't got it," said the man. "Your
clerk's eyesight is defective. I don't believe there
is a diamond missing at all from the tray. He
only thought there was."</p>

<p>Under the circumstances the customer was permitted
to leave the store, though the manager
was pretty well satisfied that the clerk had made
no mistake. Dick had seen the man examining
the diamonds, but had noticed no suspicious movement
on his part to get away with a gem. In
his opinion the man had been wrongfully accused.
Once he had seen the man put his left
hand under the outside ledge of the showcase at
the bottom and hold it there for a moment, but
he thought nothing of that. At any rate, he
knew there was no place there where a diamond
could be lodged even temporarily. The clerk
looked over the floor on the outside of the counter,
but without result, so he felt sure that the
customer had managed to get away with it somehow.
In about half an hour a lady entered the
store and went to the same counter. She wanted
to look at some new style rings. While the clerk
was producing a couple of trays, Dick, who was
close by, saw her place her hand under the bottom
ledge of the showcase and run it along there
about a foot, an action the office boy thought
strange. When she removed her hand she fumbled
for her pocket. A moment or two later she
was looking at the rings the clerk placed before
her. At that juncture the manager called Dick
and sent him down the block with a message. As
he was coming back he saw the man who had
been suspected of taking the diamond standing
near the curb about a hundred yards from the
store. He seemed to be waiting for some one.</p>

<p>Down the street came the lady whom Dick had
left examining the rings. She went directly up
to the man and handed him something. Dick saw
him hold the article up and pick at it. In another
moment he tossed something away and put
his finger and thumb into his vest pocket, then
the couple walked away. The meeting of these
two persons struck Dick as having a suspicious
bearing on the missing diamond, though just what
the connection was he could not say. He looked
at the place where he had seen the man toss
what the woman had handed him and saw a
small, dark object. He went and picked it up.
It proved to be a wad of chewing gum. Dick
was disappointed with his discovery and was
about to drop it when he noticed a deep impression
in it that looked like the imprint of a diamond.</p>

<p>Then the truth came to his bright mind like a
flash of inspiration. The missing diamond had
been stuck in the gum. Still that didn't explain
to his mind how the diamond had got there, or
how the lady who had been in the store half an
hour after the man had come in possession of
the diamond. The matter puzzled him greatly,
but of one thing he was confident, and that was
that the missing diamond was now in the man's
pocket. Under such circumstances he believed
that it was his duty to follow the pair. The couple
turned into Nassau street and walked leisurely
northward. Dick kept on behind them in a
rather doubtful frame of mind. They kept
straight on, passing the Tribune Building and the
other newspaper offices of the Row, and so on
under the Brooklyn Bridge entrance to the corner
of North William, a narrow and short street
that cuts into Park Row at that point. They
crossed the head of this street and walked into a
well-known pawnshop that stood there.</p>

<p>"I'll bet the man is going to pawn that diamond,"
thought Dick. "Well, I'm going to see if
he is."</p>

<p>He immediately followed them into the public
room. He found them standing before the long
counter. A clerk came up to them.</p>

<p>"How much will you advance me for a month
on that diamond?" asked the man, taking the
unset stone out of his pocket and laying it down
on the counter.</p>

<p>The size of the diamond corresponded with the
missing one, and on the spur of the moment Dick
glided to the counter and grabbed it before the
clerk's fingers touched it.</p>

<p>"I don't think this shop will advance you a
dollar on a stolen diamond," he said, stepping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
back defiantly, ready to maintain his employer's
claim to the stone.</p>

<p>The woman gave a stifled exclamation and looked
frightened.</p>

<p>"Give me that diamond!" cried the man.</p>

<p>"No, sir. Will you send for a policeman to settle
this matter?" said Dick to the clerk.</p>

<p>"Do you want me to send for an officer?" the
clerk asked the man.</p>

<p>"No; I can settle my own business without a
cop butting into it," replied the man savagely.</p>

<p>"Call an officer for me, then," said Dick. "I
accuse this man of stealing the diamond he asked
you to fix a price on."</p>

<p>"How dare you call me a thief!" roared the
man.</p>

<p>"Because that's what you are," answered Dick
defiantly.</p>

<p>Customers coming into the pawnshop stopped
to see what was going on. As the case stood, all
the advantage lay with Dick, for he had the article
in dispute, and possession is nine points of
the law. As the racket was highly undesirable in
the pawnshop, the clerk decided to telephone for
a policeman to come and straighten things out,
since neither Dick nor the man showed any signs
of giving in. The man himself realized that
things were growing desperate. The lady said
something to him in a low tone, but he shook his
head impatiently. Evidently somebody had told
a policeman of the case, for just at this time an
officer appeared.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V_Dick_Carries_His_Point" id="CHAPTER_V_Dick_Carries_His_Point">CHAPTER V.&mdash;Dick Carries His Point.</a></h2>


<p>"Well, what's the trouble here?" asked the officer.</p>

<p>"The trouble is that man stole a five-carat unset
diamond from our store and came here to
pawn it. I followed him and got it away from
him. I expect the manager of the store here any
moment so I want that man detained till he
comes," said Dick.</p>

<p>"It's a lie. The diamond is my property," said
the accused wrathfully.</p>

<p>"He brought a lady with him and she has just
run away," said Dick. "That looks suspicious."</p>

<p>"She was frightened by the trouble that you
raised, you young imp."</p>

<p>The policeman turned to the head clerk and
asked for the facts as far as he knew them. The
chief clerk told the officer all that had happened
from the moment the parties to the dispute made
their appearance.</p>

<p>"This boy has the diamond, then?" said the
policeman.</p>

<p>"He has," answered the pawn clerk.</p>

<p>"Hand it to me, young man."</p>

<p>Dick took it out of his pocket and turned it
over to the officer.</p>

<p>"You charge this man with the theft of the
stone from your store?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Did you see him take it?"</p>

<p>"I did not."</p>

<p>"Then how do you know he stole it?"</p>

<p>"Because circumstances point towards him."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by circumstances?"</p>

<p>Dick explained that the accused had called at
the store and asked to be shown some diamonds.
A tray of the stones had been submitted to his
inspection under the eyes of the salesman. He
looked over quite a number, and finally said the
prices were too high for him to pay. Then he
started to leave, but the salesman called him
back because he noticed that one of the diamonds
was missing. The man finally submitted to a
search in the manager's office, and the diamond
not being found on him, he was allowed to go.</p>

<p>"You see," said the accused, brightening up,
"there is no evidence against me."</p>

<p>"You admit, then, you were in our store?" said
Dick quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I never denied the fact."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" returned the boy. "A few minutes
ago you said before this clerk that you had
not been in any store this morning. Isn't that a
fact?" added Dick, turning to the head clerk.</p>

<p>"Yes, he did say that," admitted the clerk.</p>

<p>"There you are," said Dick triumphantly.</p>

<p>"I couldn't have said such a thing," protested
the man. "At any rate, you have shown that I
didn't steal the diamond from your store."</p>

<p>"I have merely admitted that I did not see you
take the stone. You'll have to explain how you
came to have the missing stone in your possession
when you came here to pawn it."</p>

<p>"That stone belongs to the lady who was with
me. It never came out of your store."</p>

<p>"All right. When the manager arrives he will
know the stone."</p>

<p>"I don't care what he will have to say about it.
The stone belongs to the lady."</p>

<p>"You have been claiming it as your own right
along."</p>

<p>"Well, what's hers is mine, in a way."</p>

<p>"Is she your wife?"</p>

<p>"It's none of your business whether she is or
not."</p>

<p>"She did not claim the stone from the time I
grabbed it till she ran away. If it was her
property, I should think she would have put up a
big kick."</p>

<p>"Where is the store you claim to be connected
with?" asked the policeman.</p>

<p>"It's at No. &mdash; John street. Mr. Roger Bacon
is the proprietor."</p>

<p>At that moment the manager of the store entered
with the diamond salesman. Both of them
immediately identified the accused as the man
who had visited the store an hour or more since,
and the manager corroborated all that Dick had
already told about the circumstances of the case.</p>

<p>"But you have no evidence against the man,"
said the policeman.</p>

<p>"I understand that he brought a diamond here
to pawn. I'd like to see it," said the manager.</p>

<p>The officer handed the five-carat stone to him.
He looked it over and handed it to the salesman.</p>

<p>"Is that the stone that you missed?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, that appears to be the stone," said the
clerk.</p>

<p>"How do you recognize it?" asked the officer,
who believed that all unset diamonds of a size
looked as much alike as all peas of a size. The
salesman explained that it was a part of his business
to make himself familiar with the looks and
quality of all diamonds he had charge of.</p>

<p>"Well, this may or may not be the stone you
assert is missing from your stock," said the policeman;
"but as long as you can't show that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
man took it, I don't see how I can run him in
without a regular warrant."</p>

<p>"I think I can throw some light on the matter,"
said Dick at this point.</p>

<p>All hands looked at him.</p>

<p>"Here's a piece of gum which I saw that man
throw into the street after picking something out
of it," he said, handing the gum to the manager.
"It evidently held the diamond, for it bears a
clear impression of a five-carat stone."</p>

<p>"It does, indeed!" said the manager.</p>

<p>"The lady who was in the store looking at
rings when you sent me on the errand came up to
that man and handed him that piece of gum. It
was the singularity of their meeting that aroused
my suspicions and caused me to watch and then
follow them to this place, particularly after I
picked the gum up and saw the impression of a
diamond in it. I judged at once that the man
must have hidden the stone in the gum and left
it somewhere about the counter where the lady
found it afterward and brought it to him."</p>

<p>Dick's words seemed to make the matter quite
clear to the manager, who was familiar with
many of the tricks adopted by diamond thieves
to ply their vocation without detection.</p>

<p>"The gum business is an old trick," said the
manager. "It's a wonder it did not occur to
you," he added, looking at the salesman. "When
a thief comes into a store he sometimes carries a
piece of adhesive gum like that," he explained to
the policeman. "The first thing he does is to
attach it to the bottom of the showcase, out of
sight. Then he watches his chance, and if he is
a sufficiently expert sleight-of-hand artist, he
manages at some time during his inspection of
the stones to convey a diamond to the gum and
force it into it. When the diamond is afterward
missed he cheerfully submits to a search, for the
stolen stone is not on his person. Later he sends
a confederate into the store to get the gum, under
cover of an intention to make some kind of
a purchase, other than diamonds, at that counter.
In this case, it is quite clear to me that the
lady was the man's confederate. I think I am
fully justified in demanding that fellow's arrest
at our risk. It is too bad that the woman got
away, but I guess we'll be able to find her. You
have her description, Dick," he said to the office
boy.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I'd recognize her on sight."</p>

<p>"Now, officer, you may arrest that man and
take him to the police station. We will go with
you and make the charge," said the manager.</p>

<p>"All right," said the policeman. "Come on, my
man, you'll have to go with me."</p>

<p>That settled the case as far as the pawnshop
was concerned, and the party directly interested
started with the officer and the prisoner for the
Brooklyn Bridge station. The charge was made
against the man, who gave his name as Jack
Hurley, and he was locked up pending his removal
to the Tombs prison. The manager, salesman
and Dick then returned to the store. The former
complimented the office boy on his smartness in
bringing the thief to justice, which would result
in the ultimate return of the valuable diamond to
the store. Mr. Bacon, who had been informed of
the theft of the stone, was duly put in possession
of Dick's clever work toward its recovery and the
punishment of the thief and, it was hoped, his
accomplice. He sent for his office boy and added
his compliments to those of the manager.</p>

<p>"You're a clever boy, Dick," he concluded, "and
I'll see that you lose nothing through your devotion
to my interests. That's all."</p>

<p>Dick got up and returned to his duty.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI_Knocked_Out" id="CHAPTER_VI_Knocked_Out">CHAPTER VI.&mdash;Knocked Out.</a></h2>



<p>Of course, the robbery of the diamond and
Dick's brilliant rounding up of the thief got into
the afternoon papers. All the merchants and
clerks of the jewelry district downtown were
talking about it before closing-up time. Dick
Darling, the boy in the knickerbockers, was voted
an uncommonly smart lad, and people who knew
Mr. Bacon told him so. One of Bacon's clerks
after reading the story in the paper called Dick
over and showed it to him. Dick bought a couple
of papers on his way home and read both
accounts. When he got to the house he handed
one of the papers to his mother and called her
attention to the story. She read it and was, of
course, much surprised. Dick supplied her with
many additional particulars not in the paper.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bacon must be greatly pleased with you,"
said Mrs. Darling.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, I dare say he thinks I'm all to
the good."</p>

<p>His sisters nearly always read the evening paper
on their way home. The diamond theft having
been given an important position on the first
page of the papers they bought that afternoon,
it attracted their attention right away. When
they saw that the theft had taken place at the
store where their brother was employed, they
read on with added interest. Then when they saw
Dick's name in cold type they became still more
interested. As he proved to be the chief figure
in the story, next to the thief, they grew quite
excited over the story. Had they been together,
their exclamations and talk would have attracted
attention in the car, but they seldom came together
on the same car or train, and so they
waited till they reached home to loosen up their
tongues. And what a jabbering there was in the
little flat when they arrived within a few minutes
of each other. They surrounded their brother
and plied him with questions, till he broke
away, declaring that they made his head ring.
Their excitement lasted all through supper. The
sum total of their opinion was that Dick was a
regular hero, and they were awfully proud of
him. The morning papers repeated the story
with a few additional details, and Dick read it
over again. Then he turned his attention to the
other news.</p>

<p>He generally saw everything that was in the
papers, though he didn't read everything, because
he hadn't time to do so. A paragraph, however,
caught his attention this morning which interested
him. It told of the escape of Bulger and
Parker from the Carlin jail. The jail was an old
one, and they had been lodged in a cell the window
bars of which proved to have become defective.
At any rate, during the short time they
were locked up there, they managed to loosen
two of the bars so they could be removed during
the night. From the window they reached the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
jail yard, scaled the tall wall with its rusty
spikes, and got away. Their escape was not discovered
until morning, when officers were at once
sent out to look for them.</p>

<p>Dick wondered if they would succeed in getting
clear off. About eleven that morning Dick, the
manager and the diamond salesman, went to the
Tombs police court to appear against Jack Hurley,
the diamond thief. He was represented by
a cheap lawyer, who employed browbeating tactics
in his client's behalf, but did not succeed in
shaking the testimony of the witnesses. Dick
being the chief witness, the lawyer spared no
pains in his efforts to tangle the boy up. Finally
he moved that his client be discharged on the
ground that there was no real evidence connecting
him with the theft of the diamond. The magistrate,
however, refused to accept his view of
the matter, and remanded Hurley to the consideration
of the Grand Jury. During that month the
store was closed at three on Saturday afternoon.
On the Saturday following the events narrated
the clerks were getting ready to leave, after having
been paid off, when a consignment of cases
containing silverware arrived from the pier of one
of the Sound steamboats. The goods had been
shipped by the factory in Rhode Island the previous
day, and had reached the city that morning,
but the truckman had not been able to fetch
them to the store until that hour.</p>

<p>As the manager had gone home, Mr. Bacon decided
to stay himself and see the cases taken in,
and detained two clerks to attend to the work
along with the porter. An hour before, Dick had
been sent up to the second floor, which was used
in part as a sample room, to arrange some of the
samples and move others out of the upright cases
standing against the walls. There was no clock
on that floor, and Dick, forgetting it was Saturday
and that the house closed early, gave no attention
to the flight of time. The cashier, thinking
he was out on an errand, left his pay envelope
on Mr. Bacon's desk, and the proprietor
seeing it there, also concluded that the manager
had sent Dick out before he left. When the
truck came up, two rough-looking men were
lounging on the opposite side of the street. They
were not there by accident, and since they came
there they had been watching the Bacon store in
a furtive way. The cases of goods were taken off
the truck and sent down into the cellar.</p>

<p>While this work was under way one of the men
strolled across the street, and, watching his
chance, sneaked into the store. He made his way
to the back and looked around. Seeing no one
there, he walked upstairs and found himself in
the sample room. The sight of numerous pieces
of choice silverware of all kinds and sizes made
him anxious, and he made up his mind to get
away with several of the least bulky ones, which
he could successfully conceal in his clothes. He
approached a case with the view of helping himself
when he suddenly came upon Dick, who was
kneeling on the floor behind a table. The boy
looked up and uttered an exclamation, for he recognized
the intruder as Bulger, whose escape
from the Carlin jail he had read about. Bulger
recognized him at the same moment, and, with
an imprecation, seized him.</p>

<p>"So I've got hold of you again," he said. "Me
and my pal have been waitin' an hour to get a
sight of you. We want to settle accounts with
you."</p>

<p>"More likely you'll be settled yourselves," said
Dick pluckily. "I've only to call out and some of
the clerks will come up and take charge of
you."</p>

<p>"You won't do any callin' out if I can help it,"
said the rascal, seizing the boy by the throat and
choking him hard. Dick struggled in vain to free
himself from the burly man's grasp, but he was
taken at a disadvantage, and found himself quite
powerless. He gasped for breath, and was turning
black in the face, when Bulger, not intending
to kill him, eased up a bit. The sight of the silverware
within his reach had put different
thoughts into the fellow's head, and seeing the
door of a closet standing ajar, he dragged Dick
to it, tied his wrists together with a piece of
cord, in a rough way, shoved him into the closet,
and shut the door tight.</p>

<p>Dick, though not wholly unconscious, was fast
becoming so from the effect of the choking, added
to the lack of air in the closet. Bulger quickly
opened a case, abstracted several small pieces
of silverware, concealed them about his person,
and hurriedly left the sample room, sneaking
downstairs and making for the front door. Mr.
Bacon and the clerks were so busily engaged
with the cases of goods that they did not notice
the rascal slip out of the door and walk down
the street, after signaling to Parker, on the other
side, to follow.</p>

<p>As soon as the goods had all been placed in
the cellar, Mr. Bacon and the two clerks re-entered
the store. The merchant went into his office
to get a small package he was going to take
home. Then the sight of Dick's pay envelope on
his desk made him remember the boy.</p>

<p>"I wonder where he was sent?" he asked himself.</p>

<p>It occurred to him to ask the clerks if they had
any idea where he was. He stepped outside
where the young men were washing their hands
and putting on their coats.</p>

<p>"Does either of you know where Dick is?" he
inquired.</p>

<p>"He's gone home," replied one of the clerks.</p>

<p>"That can't be, for his pay envelope is here
waiting for him to claim it."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" said the clerk.</p>

<p>"Yes; the cashier handed it to me and said he
believed Mr. Dale had sent him out on an errand."</p>

<p>"He might have done so, but he would have got
back long before this, for he knows that the store
closes at three on Saturday."</p>

<p>"When did you see him last?"</p>

<p>"Something over an hour ago. He was then
up on the next floor making some changes in the
sample cases."</p>

<p>"He might be up there yet."</p>

<p>"It isn't likely, for he would come down after
his money when he saw it was getting close to
closing-up time."</p>

<p>"There's no clock up there, and, besides, he
isn't a boy who watches the clock, like some employees
do for fear they will work a minute more
than they're paid for it. Dick is always interested
in his work. I've noticed that, and it is just
possible he might have overlooked the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
it is Saturday. I am going up to see if he is
there," said Mr. Bacon.</p>

<p>The clerks followed him, curious to see if the
boy was really still at work. They found no sign
of the office boy on the floor.</p>

<p>"He is not here," said Mr. Bacon. "Mr. Dale
must have sent him on an errand and he has been
delayed."</p>

<p>The three were standing near the closet as the
merchant spoke. It was at that very moment
that the subject of their thoughts finally became
senseless. Dick's head, falling forward when he
lost consciousness, hit the door, and the sound
attracted the attention of the proprietor and his
two clerks.</p>

<p>"What's that?" exclaimed Mr. Bacon.</p>

<p>He pulled the door open and the office boy fell
out.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII_Dick_and_His_Eldest_Sister" id="CHAPTER_VII_Dick_and_His_Eldest_Sister">CHAPTER VII.&mdash;Dick and His Eldest Sister.</a></h2>


<p>To say that Mr. Bacon and his clerks were both
astonished and startled would be stating the case
quite mildly.</p>

<p>"My gracious!" cried the merchant. "What
does this mean?"</p>

<p>One of the clerks stepped forward and raised
Dick up.</p>

<p>"Why, his hands are bound!" he ejaculated, in
surprise.</p>

<p>That fact was apparent to the others.</p>

<p>"Great heavens! How came he to be in this
state?" cried Mr. Bacon. "Cut him loose as quick
as you can. Jones, run down to my office and
fetch a glass of the cognac you'll find on a shelf
in the closet. This is certainly a most singular
occurrence. Somebody bound the boy and shut
him up in the closet. Nobody connected with the
store would do such a thing as that. And yet
how could a stranger have got up here unnoticed?
A thief would not attempt to carry anything
away before the clerks in the store. I
don't understand it at all."</p>

<p>Clerk Jones returned with a glass partly filled
with cognac. When Dick's head was lifted the
clerk noticed the marks of Bulger's fingers on
the boy's throat. He pointed to them and said:</p>

<p>"Look there; he's been choked."</p>

<p>"My goodness! so he was," said the merchant.
"This is a very strange affair. But we'll be able
to learn all about it as soon as he recovers his
senses."</p>

<p>The brandy was poured little by little into
Dick's mouth, and as it trickled down his throat
it revived him and brought on a coughing spell
which ended in his opening his eyes. As soon as
he was somewhat recovered, Mr. Bacon said:</p>

<p>"Now tell us what happened to you, my boy.
We found you in the closet with your wrists tied
together. It was by the merest accident that we
discovered you there. Your body fell against the
door and made a noise. But for that we should
not have known you were there, and you would
have been locked up in the building until Monday
morning."</p>

<p>Dick instinctively put his hand to his throat,
for he felt the after effects of the impress of Bulger's
fingers. With some difficulty at first, which
wore off as he proceeded, Dick told his story.</p>

<p>He explained that the man who attacked him
and put him out was one of the two rascals he
encountered down in New Jersey, and whom his
testimony had materially helped to fasten the
crime of the burglary of Mr. Mason's house upon.
The men, he said, had escaped from the Carlin
jail within a day or two of being locked up, and
it was now clear that they had not been recaptured,
but had made their escape to New York.
It seemed strange, he thought, that Bulger should
have the nerve to enter the store in quest of him,
as his few words had indicated he had. It showed
what a vindictive and desperate scoundrel he
was. Dick wound up by asking if he had stolen
anything, for it seemed likely that he would not
go away without helping himself to some of the
valuable articles that were within his easy reach.</p>

<p>That caused the clerks to examine the showcases,
and they reported that some of the small
samples in the case nearest the closet were missing
from their place. Dick got up and confirmed
their statement, for he knew exactly what was in
the showcase at the time he was attacked. An
inventory of the loss showed that it was not very
considerable&mdash;probably not over $100. Mr. Bacon
went downstairs to notify the police department
over the telephone about the affair, acquaint them
with the amount of the loss, and the fact that
the rascal who was implicated in the job had escaped,
with his pal, from the Carlin jail a few
days before, and furnish Bulger's name and description.
Dick got his pay envelope, and by that
time felt all right again. The store was then
locked up by the porter and all hands separated
for their homes. Bulger and Parker were caught
that night at a low resort frequented by men of
their stamp, and Mr. Bacon was notified by a policeman
who called at the store on Monday morning.</p>

<p>Dick was sent up to headquarters to identify
the men, which he had no trouble in doing. The
Carlin authorities were notified of their arrest,
and of the charge made against Bulger of assault
and grand larceny, on which the New York
authorities proposed to hold him until the grand
jury returned an indictment against him. The
Carlin authorities at once started extradition proceedings
in order to get the two men back to
stand trial for the robbery of Mr. Mason's house.
In the end when the papers were served on the
New York police department, the indictment
against Bulger was pigeonholed for future use,
and the men were delivered to representatives of
the Carlin police. They were tried for the burglary
almost immediately, and Dick appeared as
a witness against them. They were convicted,
Bulger, on account of his record, getting ten
years, while Parker, as it was his first offence,
was let off with five years. Dick was given a
vacation of two weeks at the time, as he had received
a pressing invitation to stay with the
Mason family.</p>

<p>He would have got a week's vacation, anyway,
as it was the month of August. The Masons
treated him as an honored guest, and he spent
most of his time in the company of Madge Mason,
who was a very pretty and companionable
girl.</p>

<p>As an evidence of his appreciation of Dick's
services, Mr. Mason deeded to Mrs. Darling, in
trust for Dick, a five-acre piece of ground, worth
about $250, which had come to him some years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
before as part of a deal he made, and which he
had no use for. Dick visited the place, which
was fenced in and was rented as a pasture to a
farmer whose property adjoined it. Mr. Mason
told Dick that some day he might be able to sell
it to a small farmer for twice its present value.
At any rate, he could easily hold it as long as
he chose, for the taxes on it were light, and it
could be kept rented at a profit over all expenses.</p>

<p>The boy was delighted to come into possession
of a piece of real estate. His ambition had always
been to own property when he grew up.
He thanked Mr. Mason for his gift, and took the
deed home with him when he returned to New
York. He handed it to his mother, as the property
stood in her name, and was so recorded at
Carlin, but the deed contained the trust clause
which practically settled the ownership of the
ground on her son. The trial of Jack Hurley
came on about the time Dick got back to the city.
The woman, who proved to be no relation of the
thief, had been found and held in the House of
Detention for Witnesses, as she agreed to appear
against the man in consideration of the charge
as a confederate being withdrawn. The result of
the trial was that Hurley got three years up the
river. After the conviction of the rascal, Mr.
Bacon presented Dick with $100. With that sum
he started a bank account in his own name.</p>

<p>"You'll be wealthy some day, Dick," said his
eldest sister, Gertie.</p>

<p>"How?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why, you have $100 and a piece of property
estimated to be worth $250, and which is likely to
increase in value as you grow older."</p>

<p>"Suppose it's worth $500 when I get to be
twenty-one, that won't make me wealthy, even
with the $100 and the interest on top of it."</p>

<p>"No, but it'll start you on the road to wealth."</p>

<p>"Maybe it will, and maybe it won't," laughed
Dick. "You may become wealthy long before I
get within hailing distance of big money."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! I haven't got a cent."</p>

<p>"I know. You girls never have a cent left out
of your princely wages, for you spend it all on
glad rags in the hope of capturing a husband
who will consider it an honor to pay all your
bills, furnish you with a fine house, an auto to
ride about in, and other et ceteras too numerous
to mention."</p>

<p>"Aren't you the horrid boy to say such a
thing!"</p>

<p>"Isn't it the truth?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, it isn't. I never expect to get married."</p>

<p>"You don't? Oh, come now, don't get off such
whoppers or the bogie man will get you when you
aren't looking."</p>

<p>"One must have a beau first, and you know I
haven't acquired such a luxury yet."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with the gent in the tall
dicer and lavender kids who calls on you regularly
every week, and takes you out to the theater
and entertainments? Mr. Clarence Peck.
He's clerk in a broker's office, with prospects of
advancement, and expectations from two maiden
aunts."</p>

<p>His sister blushed vividly, and looked a bit confused.</p>

<p>"Mr. Peck is merely a friend," she said.</p>

<p>"Well, he thinks a lot of you."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" said his sister, with another
blush.</p>

<p>"He didn't tell me so, I admit, but actions speak
louder even than his lavender kids."</p>

<p>"I wish you wouldn't make fun of his gloves.
I think they are the proper thing for him to
wear."</p>

<p>Dick chuckled.</p>

<p>"He seems to be rather bashful, though. If I
visited a girl as long as he has been coming here
to see you, I would propose and have it over
with."</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure that you would. Mr. Peck
is not bashful; he is only a little diffident. He is
very clever, but I sometimes fear that he lets his
light shine under a bushel."</p>

<p>"What has a bushel got to do with him? It
takes two pecks to make one, and he's only one
Peck."</p>

<p>"Aren't you smart! I think we'd better change
the subject."</p>

<p>"Sure I'm smart. I've proved that by helping
to catch three crooks and send them to State
prison. I think it's about time I shook these
knickerbockers and got into trousers. I'm getting
tired of being taken for a twelve-year-old
kid."</p>

<p>"Why, the idea! You look real cute in knee
pants. Mr. Peck says&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cut out what Mr. Half Bushel says. I'm the
party to be pleased. I've got a girl now, so it's
time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A girl!" exclaimed his sister, evidently astonished.</p>

<p>"Why not? Got any objection?" asked Dick
aggressively.</p>

<p>"When did this happen? Who is she?"</p>

<p>"She's an heiress. You don't suppose I would
consider any girl who hadn't prospects, do you?"
grinned Dick.</p>

<p>"Tell me her name," asked his sister, with an
air of inquisitive interest.</p>

<p>"Sorry, but I couldn't think of giving away
such a valuable secret."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know&mdash;I know!" cried his sister, clapping
her hands. "If you aren't the sly rogue!
It's Madge Mason, the girl you've been talking
so much about since you got home from your
visit to her parents' home."</p>

<p>"Well, keep it dark, sis," said Dick, with a
flush.</p>

<p>"Oh, I couldn't think of it. I must tell Nell
and May and mother."</p>

<p>"You tell them and I'll get square with you.
The next time Mr. Peck calls I'll tell him how
much you're stuck on him, and then maybe he'll
get up spunk enough to propose to you."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't dare, Richard Darling!" cried
his sister, with a burning face.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't? Well, say, you don't know me!
It's up to you. Keep mum about Miss Mason and
I'll be good; otherwise&mdash;you know what'll happen."</p>

<p>Then Dick walked out of the room, satisfied
that his sister would be as mute as a mop stick.</p>

<p>We will pass over two years, during which Dick
ceased to be an office boy and became one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
most gentlemanly clerks in Mr. Bacon's store.
His knickerbockers disappeared the day after the
conversation he had with his sister, as detailed in
the previous chapter, and he made his appearance
at the store in a new suit of clothes, which so
changed him that the boss and clerks hardly recognized
him at first. The change developed a new
line of witticism on the part of his young friends,
but Dick took the bull by the horns in so energetic
a way that the funny lads shut up in short
order.</p>

<p>Dick now felt that he was a real man, except
in years, and during the ensuing two years he
deported himself along that line, and was made
a clerk before the merchant had expected to raise
him to that dignity; but the fact was when the
knickerbockers went to the scrap heap Mr. Bacon
decided that he looked too old to continue as
his office boy, hence his promotion. During these
two years Dick visited the Masons several times&mdash;spending
the Christmas holidays with them
twice, the Easter week-end once, and two weeks
in each summer.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving was now approaching and he had
received an invitation to come down and spend
the interval between Wednesday afternoon till
Monday morning, and Mr. Bacon very graciously
gave him permission to do so. Dick was very
glad to visit the Masons, not alone because he
always received a royal welcome from the family
as a whole, but because Madge Mason was now
"sweet sixteen," and growing more charming every
day. The fact that Madge was heiress to all
her parents' worldly goods had really no bearing
on his feelings toward the pretty miss. Of course
it was nice to think that her future was provided
for, but Dick liked her for herself alone, just as
she entertained the same feelings toward him.
Their friendship was firmly established, and both
were never so happy as when together. Perhaps
the fact that they were together so seldom, and
then only for a short time, enhanced the feeling
each felt toward the other. Presumedly the girl's
father and mother noticed the growing interest
that existed between their daughter and the
young New York clerk. Certainly they put no
obstacles in the young people's way, which may
be taken as evidence that they approved of it.
Madge's aunt had a clearer insight into the matter
than any one else, because the girl made a
confidante of her. The Mason automobile was at
the railroad station in Carlin waiting for Dick,
who had written that he would come by express
which left Jersey City at five-thirty. In the
auto, besides the gardener, who acted as chauffeur,
sat Miss Madge, in a warm gown trimmed
with fur, while her pretty head was adorned with
a bewitching fur cap, tilted on one side. The
train came in on time and Dick jumped off with
other passengers, carrying a small suit-case in
his hand. Madge saw him at once and waved her
handkerchief at him. Dick saw the signal, recognized
the girl, and lost no time in reaching
the automobile.</p>

<p>"This is quite an honor, Miss Madge," said
Dick, raising his derby and stepping in beside his
charmer.</p>

<p>"Really, do you think so?" replied Madge, as
the gardener started off.</p>

<p>"I certainly do. I never dreamed I should have
so charming a companion on my ride to the
house," he replied gallantly.</p>

<p>"Dear me, you say that awfully nice," returned
the girl blushingly. "How are your mother
and sisters?"</p>

<p>Dick assured her that they were quite well,
and then asked after Mr. and Mrs. Mason and
Miss Woods, the aunt.</p>

<p>"They're very well, indeed," said Madge.</p>

<p>"And how is Cleopatra?" asked Dick, who felt
that so important a member of the family as
Madge's pet cat must not be overlooked lest he
incur the young lady's displeasure.</p>

<p>"Oh, Cleo is all right. She is really getting
cuter every day."</p>

<p>"Can she stand on her head yet?" chuckled
Dick.</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Madge. "Who ever heard
of cats standing on their heads?"</p>

<p>Dick laughed and the conversation changed to
another subject, during which they were whirled
over the three miles of road and landed at the
front door of the country house where Mr. Mason
was on hand to welcome Dick. Next morning
after breakfast Dick took a stroll over to his
property, more for the exercise of walking than
anything else, for he had viewed his five-acre
plot often enough to know its layout by heart;
besides, the month of November was a poor time
to look at country land, which was wearing a
wintry aspect. A lot of young trees had started
growing over a part of his land, and at the edge
of this section he was surprised to see a small
wooden hut and round it two good-sized tents.
It looked as if a family of squatters had camped
upon his property. He saw a couple of small
children playing around the door of the hut, and
from its stovepipe smoke was floating upward.</p>

<p>"I like their nerve taking possession of my
place," he thought, as he leaned over the fence
and looked.</p>

<p>A young woman with a bright-colored shawl
over her head and shoulders came out of the hut
with a tin pail in her hand and went in the direction
of a spring. Then Dick noticed a covered
wagon of the prairie schooner kind, and beside it
another rude, oblong building. He wondered that
Mr. Mason hadn't told him about these free tenants,
who had apparently taken root there for the
winter at least. Curious to find out something
about them, he got over the fence and walked toward
the camp. A rough-looking man came out
of one of the tents, with a pipe in his mouth, and
looked at him. Dick walked up to him and asked
him what he and the rest of the bunch were doing
there.</p>

<p>"We are gypsies," replied the man, who was
dark skinned and sported a black mustache. "We
are camping here till next spring."</p>

<p>"Got permission to stay from the owner?" asked
Dick.</p>

<p>A peculiar smile flickered about the man's
mouth.</p>

<p>"We never ask permission. Why should we?
The earth was made for all. We are only occupying
a small part of it for the time being when
the land is of no use to anybody."</p>

<p>"Then you have settled here as a sort of winter
quarters. During the rest of the year you
travel about the country, eh?"</p>

<p>The man nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"We travel from place to place, staying as long
as we choose. You do not look like a country
boy. You have come here from some town or
city."</p>

<p>"That's right. I belong in New York. It happens,
however, that I own this piece of property."</p>

<p>"You do?" said the man, with an accent on the
"you," looking Dick over curiously.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You object to our being here, perhaps?" said
the gypsy, with a frown.</p>

<p>"On, no, as long as you intend to start off in
the spring."</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Richard Darling. What's yours?"</p>

<p>"Hugh Blacklock."</p>

<p>"You're the boss of this outfit, I suppose?"</p>

<p>The gypsy shook his head.</p>

<p>"Miriam is the head of our branch. There are
seven of us, besides the children."</p>

<p>"Miriam!" said Dick. "That's a woman's
name."</p>

<p>The man nodded.</p>

<p>"What's her other name?"</p>

<p>"That is the name she goes by. Perhaps you
would like to see her? If you cross her palm
with a piece of silver she will tell your fortune."</p>

<p>"I suppose that's the way you live&mdash;by telling
fortunes?"</p>

<p>"That and selling fancywork. Come, I will introduce
you to Miriam."</p>

<p>As Dick was curious to see the woman who was
at the head of this small tribe of gypsies, he
followed his conductor, and was taken into the
hut. Miriam proved to be a woman of middle
age, whose features were not unpleasant. She
had raven black hair streaming down her back,
and an eye as dark as a sloe. Her attire was
shabby, with the exception of a bright-colored
shawl worn carelessly across her shoulders. The
man spoke to her in a strange tongue, and she
regarded Dick with some attention.</p>

<p>"You are a brave-looking boy," she said. "Shall
I tell your fortune? Come, cross my hand with
silver, and I will see what the future holds in
store for you."</p>

<p>Dick wasn't particularly curious about his future,
and he rather doubted the ability of the
woman to foretell anything of importance. However,
he concluded to help the tribe along to the
extent of a silver quarter, so he pulled the coin
out and placed it in her hand.</p>

<p>"Your left hand," she said.</p>

<p>Dick presented it. She pored over the lines
and mounds, which palmistry teaches mean so
much, for a minute or more before speaking
again.</p>

<p>"You were born of parents in moderate circumstances,
and you are the youngest of four children,"
she said.</p>

<p>"That's hitting the mark pretty close," he
thought. "I wonder how she can get that out of
my hand?"</p>

<p>"One of your parents is dead," she continued,
"and it seems to be your father."</p>

<p>"Another good guess," thought Dick.</p>

<p>"You had to go to work young, about your
fourteenth year."</p>

<p>"That's right," admitted the boy. "Maybe you
can tell me what business I am engaged in?"</p>

<p>"It is something genteel&mdash;a clerk in a store or
office. You have been in danger twice within the
last three years from evil-disposed persons. You
are fated to make many friends, some of whom
will help you forward in life, but your success
will make enemies&mdash;you have already made three,
two of whom have had something to do with the
peril in which you have been placed. Since then
life has run smoother with you, but beware, there
is trouble hanging over you now."</p>

<p>"Trouble!" exclaimed Dick. "I see none ahead."</p>

<p>"Trouble comes when we are not looking for
it."</p>

<p>"Well, give me a pointer on it. You ought to
be able to tip me off how to get out of it."</p>

<p>"Beware of a tall, dark man and a short, light
woman."</p>

<p>"That's rather indefinite."</p>

<p>"There is a connection between them and your
business."</p>

<p>"My business, eh? This is getting interesting."</p>

<p>The woman frowned and changed the subject.</p>

<p>"You have a sweetheart and you are closer to
her now than usual. She is the bright star of
your life&mdash;whom you will marry. Three children
will bless your marriage, and you will pass a
large part of your life in the country."</p>

<p>"If you see all that in my hand, it is quite
clear that the trouble you say is hanging over
me now will not lay me out."</p>

<p>"You will always triumph over your enemies,
but they will do you much harm. Fortune will
soon smile on you. You are about to come into
possession of riches."</p>

<p>"Where am I going to get it? I have no such
expectation."</p>

<p>"Good luck, like trouble, often comes upon us
unaware. At this moment you are close to a
fortune in money."</p>

<p>"The dickens I am! I'm afraid you're making
a mistake there."</p>

<p>"It is so written in your hand and will come to
pass."</p>

<p>She dropped Dick's hand and the seance was
over.</p>

<p>"Your hand is, on the whole, a lucky one," she
said. "The fates smiled on you at your birth.
Favorable planets were in happy aspect. Saturn
alone casts its malignant influence across your
life's path, but will not prevail."</p>

<p>With a sweep of her arm toward the door,
Dick understood that he was dismissed, and he
walked back to the house somewhat impressed by
what he had learned.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<p>When Dick reached the house, he found Madge
waiting for him.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I walked down the road as far as my property.
Did you know there were gypsies camped
on it?"</p>

<p>"Why, no; are there?"</p>

<p>"Yes. They have two tents, a hut, a wagon,
and a sort of rough barn for their horses."</p>

<p>"They have no right to camp there. They are
trespassing."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, they won't harm the property, and
they'll go away in the spring."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"How do you know? Were you speaking to
them?"</p>

<p>"I talked with one of the men, and with the
woman who heads the tribe. Her name is Miriam,
and she told my fortune."</p>

<p>"Really?" cried the girl, with a smile. "What
did she tell you?"</p>

<p>"Many things that I know to be true, and some
things that I hope will turn out true."</p>

<p>"Then your fortune was a good one?"</p>

<p>"On the whole, it was. You'd better call on
her and have your fortune told."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I will, if aunty will go with me.
Come, now, tell me what she told you."</p>

<p>Dick repeated as near as he could remember
all that the gypsy woman had read in his hand,
with the exception of that part referring to his
sweetheart.</p>

<p>"I suppose she said you'd marry the girl of
your choice and live happily ever afterward,"
laughed Madge slyly.</p>

<p>"Sure; they always put that in to make you
feel good."</p>

<p>"So she said you were going to come into a
fortune soon? Isn't that nice?"</p>

<p>"It's too nice to be true."</p>

<p>"It might happen."</p>

<p>"I haven't a rich relative in the world whose
death would put me on Easy street."</p>

<p>"Then you'll get the money some other way."</p>

<p>"I don't know of any other way unless I robbed
a bank, and I'm not likely to do that."</p>

<p>"You might find a pocketbook full of money."</p>

<p>"If I did I'd return it to the owner if I could
locate him."</p>

<p>"Well, let us hope you will get the money
somehow. Most people wouldn't worry how money
came to them as long as they got it."</p>

<p>Dick agreed with her, and then they began
talking about other things. On Monday morning
eleven o'clock a small, stylishly dressed lady, of
a blonde complexion, came into the store and
asked for Mr. Bacon. She was shown into his
office, where she introduced herself as Mrs. Patterson.
She said she had been recommended to
Mr. Bacon's store by the Rev. John Dobbs, pastor
of a certain church. The church in question
was the one that the merchant was connected
with, and the pastor was a warm friend of his.
She said that the Rev. Dobbs had given her a
note to hand to Mr. Bacon, but she had lost or
mislaid it, for it was not in her bag. The merchant
asked her what he could do for her, and
she said she had called to look at his stock of
silver cups and a few other articles in the silver
line. Mr. Bacon said he would be very glad to
give her every opportunity to make a selection
from among his latest samples, and he assigned
Dick to wait on her, as the boy was very successful
in dealing with the lady customers of the
house.</p>

<p>So Dick took her up to the sample room and
let her see what was on exhibition in the lines
she wanted. The boy had engaging ways that
always took with the ladies, so he never had any
difficulty in handling them to their own satisfaction
and that of his employer. Mr. Bacon had
given him a quiet tip that Mrs. Patterson was a
special customer who had been recommended to
him, so Dick laid himself out to please her. He
appeared to have no trouble in doing so, for in a
short time she made quite a number of purchases
of the finest and most expensive articles,
and giving her address to Dick said that she
wanted the ware delivered C. O. D. at her residence
that afternoon at six o'clock. Her husband
would be home at that hour and would pay the
bill in cash. She then left the store, after picking
out an expensive diamond pin to be sent with
the other goods. Dick turned the order and the
directions in to his boss, who O. K.'d it and handed
it over to his manager, through whom it proceeded
to the packer, who got the articles from
Dick, and the ring from the diamond salesman.
About closing time Mr. Bacon called Dick into
his office.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd take that package up to Mrs.
Patterson's house, if it is not too heavy for you,"
the merchant said. "It is on your way home, and
as the bill amounts to $700, I'd rather you would
collect it than a messenger."</p>

<p>"All right, sir," answered Dick, who was always
willing to oblige his employer.</p>

<p>He got the package, which weighed about twenty
pounds, and left the store with it at a quarter-past
five, when the porter closed up. The address
Mrs. Patterson had given was on the West
Side, in a district wholly occupied by fine private
houses, except in a few instances, where there
were handsome apartment houses on the corners.
Dick took the elevated at Cortlandt street station
and at ten minutes of six got out at the nearest
station on Columbus avenue to the block he was
bound for. It still wanted a minute or two of
six when he mounted the high stoop of the handsome
house which bore Mrs. Patterson's number.
He rang the bell, and after the lapse of five
minutes, during which interval he was, without
his knowledge, inspected through the inside
blinds on the parlor floor, a tall man, in good
clothes, with a dark complexion, opened the door
and asked him what he wanted.</p>

<p>"Does Mrs. Henry Patterson live here?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"She does," replied the man. "Are you from
Mr. Bacon's store on John street?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"Walk in."</p>

<p>Dick entered and the heavy vestibule door was
closed behind him.</p>

<p>"You have brought the bill for the goods with
you?" said the man, in smooth tones, as he led
the way inside the inner door.</p>

<p>"I have."</p>

<p>"Very well. I am Mr. Patterson. As soon as
my wife has examined the articles and checked
them off I will pay you the money for them."</p>

<p>The interior of the house, so far as Dick could
judge from the looks of the hall, was in keeping
with its external indications.</p>

<p>"Follow me upstairs to the sitting room," said
Mr. Patterson.</p>

<p>Dick was introduced into the front room on the
second floor which was handsomely furnished.
The gentleman took the package and the itemized
bill and pointed to a chair. Then he left the
room. Ten minutes elapsed, during which Dick
heard not a sound. The house was as silent as
the grave. Then the door opened and Mr. Patterson
reappeared.</p>

<p>"The articles are all right and my wife has O.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
K.'d the bill," he said. "Step this way and I will
pay you."</p>

<p>Dick got up and followed him into the back
room on the same floor. A chair was drawn up
at the marble center table, and the boy was invited
to be seated. Mr. Patterson went to a
closet behind the boy and presently returned with
a bunch of money, which he laid, with the bill,
in front of him.</p>

<p>"Count it, please, and see that the sum is correct,"
said the gentleman.</p>

<p>Dick proceeded to do so. Mr. Patterson went
back to the closet. In a moment or two he approached
the boy so softly that Dick did not hear
his steps. Even if he had he would have paid no
attention to the gentleman's movements. Every
one, it is said, is endowed with an instinctive
sense that seems to be awakened by the unseen
or unsuspected presence of another person in the
room with us, particularly when that person is
standing close behind. We cannot go into an
explanation here of the phenomenon, but that it
frequently comes to pass is an undoubted fact.</p>

<p>Certain it is Dick experienced it at that moment
while he was counting the bunch of bills
which seemed to be all five-dollar ones, and without
any intention on his part he mechanically
raised his eyes and looked straight ahead. They
rested on the surface of a mirror hanging
against the wall facing him. In the fraction of
time at his disposal he was startled to see the
form of Mr. Patterson towering about him, his
arm uplifted in the act of bringing a slungshot
down upon his head. The weapon was actually
descending when Dick caught sight of it, and he
dodged his head aside. The round iron ball swept
his ear like a shot and landed just beyond his
collar-bone, the man's hand striking his shoulder
with considerable force. Dick slid off the chair
on his hands and knees, and though much shaken
up, was on his feet in a moment, for he was as
active as a cat. There was a terrible look in
the man's eyes as they confronted each other,
then he sprang at Dick with a hissing imprecation.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X_Dicks_Strenuous_Experience" id="CHAPTER_X_Dicks_Strenuous_Experience">CHAPTER X.&mdash;Dick's Strenuous Experience.</a></h2>


<p>Dick, alive to his danger, side-stepped and
launched out his fist at his assailant, catching
him in the jaw with a blow that staggered him
and caused him to drop the weapon. Before Dick
could get in another effective blow, the man had
him in his grasp, and a desperate struggle for
the mastery took place between them. Over and
over they rolled upon the rug, first one on top
and then the other, but neither could maintain
the temporary advantage. In the midst of it the
door slowly opened and a woman looked in&mdash;the
short, blonde lady who had made the purchases
at the store. She gazed with dilated eyes on the
struggle that was going on. Neither of the combatants
saw her at the moment so intent were
they on their own exertions. Slowly she opened
the door until her handsome form stood fully revealed.
She appeared to be nerving herself to
go to the aid of the man who had represented
himself as her husband. Gradually she entered
the room, with an almost imperceptible motion,
until her gaze rested on the slungshot. The
sight of it brought animation into her movements.
She swooped down on it with a rush, and then
the man took notice of her presence.</p>

<p>"Grab him, Fanny; he's as strong as a young
bear," he cried.</p>

<p>At that moment Dick managed to get on top
of his man again. He saw the woman's dress and
looked up. She had the weapon raised to strike
him.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you here!" she cried, in startled tones,
as she recognized the young clerk who had waited
on her with such polite attention that she had
felt attracted to him.</p>

<p>The blow did not fall. She crouched in the act
of delivering it as if she had suddenly been transformed
into a nerveless thing.</p>

<p>"Hit him&mdash;hit him!" hissed her husband, making
no move to upset the boy, but trying his best
to hold him at the woman's mercy.</p>

<p>"No, no, I can't, Jim; I can't strike that boy.
He ought not to have come here. I did not dream
that he would. He must not be hurt," she articulated,
in an agitated voice.</p>

<p>"Are you mad, Fan? The boy has us in his
power unless he is done up. Strike him and get
it over with, do you hear me!"</p>

<p>"I can't," returned the woman, almost pathetically.
"He reminds me of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Blast your squeamishness! You will ruin us."</p>

<p>"We must adopt other means to silence him till
we are safe," she said.</p>

<p>She looked feverishly about the room. Her
eyes rested on a small bottle on the mantel.
Flinging the slungshot down, she bounded over
and seized it. Tearing a lace handkerchief from
her bosom, she dashed some of the contents of
the bottle on it. In the meantime the struggle
between Dick and the man was renewed. Patterson
succeeded in pulling the boy over on the rug
again. As he held him there, the woman slipped
over, threw her weight on Dick's side and pressed
the handkerchief over his face. Dick struggled
desperately, for he knew he was being drugged,
but he had not the ghost of a show.</p>

<p>"It is better this way, Jim," she said. "Oh,
why did he come here? Why did he come?"</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?" growled Patterson,
allowing matters to take their course.
"What interest have you in that boy?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, indeed I don't; but he is a nice
boy, and he looks so like my brother!" she faltered.</p>

<p>"Oh, hang your brother! What has your brother
got to do with him?"</p>

<p>As Dick's struggles ceased the woman lifted
the handkerchief. The boy was unconscious.</p>

<p>"Look at him, Jim; isn't he a handsome boy?
And he treated me at the store as if I were a
real lady."</p>

<p>Jim Patterson, if his name really was Patterson,
which seemed doubtful after what had happened,
uttered an imprecation as he got up.</p>

<p>"Now, then, you soft-hearted thing, go and
find a piece of line for me to tie him with," he
said.</p>

<p>"You won't do anything to him while I'm gone,
will you, Jim?" she said anxiously.</p>

<p>"Why should I? He's down and out now for
six or eight hours, which will give us time to
skip. There's nothing in the house, except our
trunks and duds that belong to us, for we took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
the place furnished. When the servant returns
in the morning she'll find the boy and liberate
him. By that time we'll be a long way on our
way West. We have cleaned up quite a stake
since we've been here, and can live on Easy street
for a while. I'm afraid I made a mistake in pulling
off this last trick. There isn't enough in it
for the risk we ran. You ought to have bought
more diamonds while you were about it."</p>

<p>"I was afraid to buy too much lest it should
have excited suspicion," she said.</p>

<p>"We won't quarrel over it. Go and get the
line."</p>

<p>The woman left the room, her dress rustling on
the stairs. In a short time, during which Patterson
took the money from the table and put it in
his pocket and paced up and down the room, she
came back with a length of clothes-line. Dick
was carried into a small bedroom on that floor
and his arms bound to his sides by half a dozen
turns of the rope, which was then knotted at his
back. There he was left to lie like a dead one on
the bed until well along in the evening, when the
Pattersons were ready to leave the house for good,
when Jim intended to carry him downstairs to
the basement where the servant would find him
in the morning when she returned. After the
woman had completed the balance of the packing,
she and Jim went out to their dinner. When
they got back the expressman Patterson had arranged
with early in the day to take their trunks
to the Pennsylvania ferry was waiting for them.
He took away all their baggage. Soon afterward
Patterson carried the unconscious boy downstairs,
placed him upright in a kitchen chair, with the
table for a support, and then the rascal locked
up the house and placed the key of the front
door under the iron area gate where the servant
would see it when she came in the morning, and
with his wife started for the railroad station.</p>

<p>They had been gone about an hour when Dick
recovered his senses. He discovered his bound
condition at once, and wondered where he was,
for the room he was in was pitch dark. He pushed
back the chair with his feet, which he saw
were not tied, and got up. His eyes were accustomed
to the darkness so he soon made out the
outline of the stove and other things that showed
him that he was in the kitchen, which he judged
was in the basement of the house. Walking toward
the door, which he found standing open, he
passed into the lower hall up which he went to
the door that opened on to the small space within
the area gate and directly under the stoop and
the stairs to the sidewalk. Bending sideways a
little, he seized the handle and turned, but it was,
as he supposed, locked. He bent lower and felt
for the key, but it was missing, for the servant
had taken it with her, along with the key of the
gate. He saw that he couldn't get out there, so
he thought he would venture to try the front
door. He walked softly upstairs, for he supposed
the man and his wife were still in the
house. There was no light in the hall and the
house was as silent as the grave, from which
fact Dick circulated that it was very late.</p>

<p>He went to the front door, the inner one, but
again he was stumped, for that key was missing,
too. That seemed to indicate that Patterson and
his wife had left the premises. This appeared to
be a reasonable conclusion under the circumstances.
They would hardly remain all night after
what they had been guilty of. If they had
fled the place, they had left a furnished house
behind them, and the boy presumed that the furnishings
belonged to them. He wondered if the
man had intended to kill him, and that the woman
had saved his life.</p>

<p>The recollection of that awful sight of the descending
slungshot he had caught sight of in the
mirror, and which he shuddered to recall, and
would never forget as long as he lived, made him
think so. Believing that he was probably alone
in the house, after all, he became less cautious in
moving about. He turned the knob of the parlor
door and walked into that big room. He could
see the ghostly-looking pieces of furniture standing
about, an upright piano, and the dim effect of
walls covered with pictures. He went through
into the back room, the folding doors of which
stood open.</p>

<p>Here for the first time he heard a sound&mdash;the
ticking of the gilt ormulo clock on a fancy shelf.
The room was furnished as a library. There were
bookcases filled with books, and a desk by the
back window, the shades of which were down.
Suddenly the thought occurred to him to see if
there was a telephone in the room. He believed
that houses of that class were nearly always
equipped with one. Whether Patterson had use
for such a convenience or not he could not say.
When the man rented the house there was a
telephone in it, and though he had little use for
it, and as he did not intend to occupy the place
long, he let it remain, and Dick discovered it attached
to the wall beside the desk. He humped
his shoulder and knocked the receiver off the
hook. It fell upon his shoulder and lay close to
his ear.</p>

<p>As soon as he heard the voice of the girl ask
for the number wanted he put his mouth near
the mouthpiece and said:</p>

<p>"Give me police headquarters&mdash;very urgent!"</p>

<p>Then he tilted his ear toward the receiver
again. Presently he heard a man's voice call,
"Hello!"</p>

<p>"Is this police headquarters?"</p>

<p>"Yes," came back the answer.</p>

<p>"Send a policeman to No. 164 West &mdash;&mdash; street
at once. I am locked in the house and my arms
are bound to my sides. I am the victim of a pair
of crooks, a man and a woman. The doors are
locked so the officer will have to come prepared
to force his entrance through the area gate or
one of the windows. I am telephoning under
great difficulties, so please don't ask questions,
but act at once."</p>

<p>"All right," was the answer returned, and the
officer closed his circuit.</p>

<p>As Dick couldn't replace the receiver, he had to
let it drop the length of its covered wire, and
the telephone girl soon saw that something was
wrong, and she began ringing.</p>

<p>"Hello!" said Dick, returning to the phone.
"The receiver is hanging and I can't replace it
because my arms are bound. The circuit will
have to remain open till the police get here.
That's all," said Dick, judging that the call came
from the girl at the central office.</p>

<p>She evidently understood and reported the situation,
for the bell did not ring any more. Dick
left the library and made his way down to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
dining room in the front of the basement to
watch for the coming of the policeman. In a
short time he saw an officer come in sight and
stop in front of the house next door. A second
policeman joined him a moment later and pointed
to the right house. They started down into the
areaway.</p>

<p>Dick at once pounded on the window with his
forehead, the best he could do. The policeman
heard the sounds and came up to the window,
which was protected by diamond-shaped iron-work.
Through this they peered and could just
make out the boy's face pressed against the pane.
One of them took an electric flashlight cylinder
from his pocket and turned the light on Dick's
form. They saw at once how his arms were
bound alongside his body.</p>

<p>Then the officer turned the light on the iron
area gate. As he looked it over, he saw the key
on the floor just inside. He reached for it and
tried it on the gate, but saw right away that it
wouldn't fit. They conversed a minute, then leaving
the area, they went up to the front door and
found no trouble in opening the outer portal.
Flashing the light on the inside door, they saw
the key standing in the lock. In another moment
they were in the house and Dick heard their
heavy tread on the stairs, coming down. Within
a minute he stood in the full glare of the flashlight,
while the policemen were sizing him up.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI_Guilt_Sees_Its_Finish" id="CHAPTER_XI_Guilt_Sees_Its_Finish">CHAPTER XI.&mdash;Guilt Sees Its Finish.</a></h2>


<p>"My, but I'm glad you've come!" said Dick, in
a tone of relief. "Cut me free, please."</p>

<p>"How came you to be in this shape?" asked
the officer with the flashlight, while the other
produced his knife and began severing the clothes
line.</p>

<p>Dick told his story in as few words as possible,
beginning with the appearance of the richly
dressed blonde woman at his store that morning.
The policeman listened with attention.</p>

<p>"That fellow is no common rascal," said one of
them, "and his name isn't Patterson, for a dollar
bill. They have left the house of course?"</p>

<p>"I judge so, for I haven't heard a sound since I
recovered my senses nearly an hour ago. Besides,
the house appears to be locked up from
the outside, or was until you came and got in.
How did you manage to do it?"</p>

<p>The policeman told him about finding the key
inside of the area gate, where it had evidently
been placed by the man when he and the woman
left.</p>

<p>"Well, come along to the police station with us,
and we'll lock up the house again after we search
it thoroughly. How much was the package worth
you brought here?"</p>

<p>"Seven hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"They've got away with that, at any rate."</p>

<p>On their way upstairs Dick went into the library
and replaced the telephone receiver on its
hook. The officers were astonished to find the
house so elegantly furnished, and they came to
the erroneous conclusion that the family who
occupied it was away, and that the crook and his
accomplice had learned of the fact and taken possession
of it for the purpose of working that
particular job. The truth came out later when
the police made a thorough investigation of the
case.</p>

<p>The house was looked over from cellar to the
top floor, and nothing was to be seen but the
furniture and furnishings, just as the house had
been rented. The officers were of the opinion
that Patterson had cleaned out everything that
was worth carrying off. It was about midnight
now, and Dick went with the policemen to the
station to which they were attached, and told his
story over again, with more detail, to the man at
the desk. He furnished a first-rate description
of Patterson and of the woman he claimed as his
wife, and after Dick was allowed to go home several
detectives were put out on the case. Dick
got home about one o'clock and found his family
all exercised over his failure to come home at a
reasonable hour.</p>

<p>Only two of his sisters were now living in the
flat, as Gertie, the elder, had succeeded in hooking
Clarence Peck, and the young couple were
living in a small genteel flat of their own. Dick
had to explain the cause that had detained him,
and his mother and two sisters were horrified
over the recital.</p>

<p>"What a narrow escape you had, my dear boy!"
said his mother tearfully.</p>

<p>"That's right, but don't let us talk about it. Is
there anything handy that I can eat?" he said.</p>

<p>"I'll warm up something," said Nellie, "while
May will make you a cup of tea."</p>

<p>The girls prepared him a meal and after eating
it he turned in with the others. His story was in
the morning papers, and the first inkling that
Mr. Bacon, his manager and the clerks got of it
was through the morning journals. Dick appeared
at the store on time, and in advance of the
other employees, and as they arrived they gathered
around him and bombarded him with questions.
He satisfied their curiosity as well as he
could, and when the manager turned up he took
the boy in his room and asked him to give him
the whole story. Then Mr. Bacon appeared and
Dick was closeted with him for half an hour.</p>

<p>The manager in the meanwhile had communicated
with the police, who told him they were
working on the case, but so far without results.
During the day one of the people who lived opposite
the house where the adventure happened to
Dick, after reading the story in the paper, reported
to the police that he had seen an expressman
take two trunks and two suitcases out of the
house at about half-past eight on the evening
before. By that time the police had learned the
name of the owner of the house and its contents,
and learned from his representative that Patterson
had leased the place for a year, giving certain
references. He had paid only one month's
rent&mdash;the first. The second month would be due
in a few days, thereby showing that Patterson
and his accomplice had occupied the house but
one month. The servant had been found in the
house and interviewed by a policeman. She was
very much astonished to learn of the character of
the parties who had engaged her as a cook and
general domestic.</p>

<p>She had been with them since they took possession,
and thought them very nice people,
though she saw little of the man. Under close
questioning she called to mind many things which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the detectives regarded as suspicious. In the
course of a day or two some of Patterson's operations
came to light, and the police picked up
many clues concerning his movements while he
was living at the house.</p>

<p>It was three days before the expressman who
carried the trunks to the ferry was found, for he
had been paid to keep a stiff upper lip, and had
tried to keep out of the way, then the authorities
got wise to the fact that the guilty couple had
gone out of the city via the Pennsylvania road.
By following the clue, the pair was traced to
Pittsburg, and from there to Cincinnati, thence to
St. Louis, where they were caught and brought
back to New York.</p>

<p>Dick was called on to identify them, which he
readily did. As he felt a certain gratitude toward
the little blonde woman who had refused
to lay him out with the slungshot, he would liked
to have made matters as easy for her as possible;
but there was no getting around her part of the
business, and so she was held for grand larceny,
and criminal participation in the other operations
which were brought against the man who was
supposed to be her husband. In the end she was
sent to Auburn, while Patterson got a long sentence
at Sing Sing, but Mr. Bacon recovered
none of his loss, not even the diamond ring.</p>

<p>The merchant did not blame Dick for the loss
of his goods. It was clear that the game had
been too slickly worked for the boy to have acted
differently than he had done. On the whole, Mr.
Bacon thought his young clerk a lucky boy to
have escaped with his life. Dick spent his third
Christmas week with the Masons, and made further
progress in the good opinion of the gentleman,
his wife and the sister-in-law, and more
firmly established himself in the heart of Madge.
He visited the gypsy camp again and told Miriam
of the peril he had passed through in connection
with the Pattersons.</p>

<p>"Did I not tell you to beware of a tall, dark
man and a short, light woman?" said the gypsy
queen.</p>

<p>"By George, you're right! Do you know, that
fact has never occurred to me till this moment,"
admitted Dick. "The man was tall and dark, and
the woman was a small blonde. I was lucky to
fare no worse than I did."</p>

<p>"It was the benign influence of your favorable
planets that saved you from death. How old are
you?"</p>

<p>"I was eighteen about six months ago," said
Dick.</p>

<p>"It is as I thought. You were threatened with
a sudden and violent death through the position
of Saturn in the sky at the moment you entered
that house in the city; and but for other planetary
influences in your favor you would have
fared badly."</p>

<p>"How can you tell all that without even looking
at my hand?"</p>

<p>"I recall much that your hand told me, and
the circumstances you have related to me enables
me to make those deductions."</p>

<p>"Hand-reading and astrology seem to be more
or less alike."</p>

<p>"They must agree, or there would be nothing in
either. Cartomancy, which means the reading
of the past, present or future through cards, also
coincides with the other two, reaching the same
results. Why, I can tell your character and all
your characteristics by merely studying your
physical appearance. You have a compact body,
well-developed chest, and other traits that show
at a glance the influence of the Sun and Jupiter
at your birth, and indicate to an ordinary observer
that you are endowed with good health and a
resistance against disease. The color of your
eyes, and hair, the size and shape of your hands,
your ears, your eyebrows, all tell their story as
clearly as if described in print. The very flush
that you bear upon your cheeks shows beyond a
doubt that you were born in the cycle of the
Sun."</p>

<p>"You gypsies are a great people in your way, I
am bound to say," said Dick, regarding Miriam
with increased respect.</p>

<p>"Our ancestors came from Egypt. We are an
old race."</p>

<p>"Well, I've got to be going," said Dick.</p>

<p>"You are bound back to the city&mdash;soon?"</p>

<p>"On the day after New Year's."</p>

<p>"When you return we will have departed, so I
will say good-by forever."</p>

<p>"Maybe not. I expect to return at Easter."</p>

<p>"Unless the weather is backward, we will be
on the move before then," she said. "One last
look at your hand."</p>

<p>Dick gave it to her.</p>

<p>"I told you that you were coming into a fortune
before long."</p>

<p>"I remember that you did. But there is very
little chance of such a thing happening."</p>

<p>"The fortune will come to you around Easter."</p>

<p>"In what way?" asked Dick curiously.</p>

<p>"It is already yours. Indeed, you have been in
possession of this fortune for three years."</p>

<p>"I have? Then it can't amount to much."</p>

<p>"It is a fortune in money."</p>

<p>"Why, I have been in possession of no money
over a couple of hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"You have, but even now you know it not."</p>

<p>"How can I possess something and not be
aware of the fact?"</p>

<p>"You will understand within four months.
When the time comes, you will recall my words
and say Miriam was right. She can read that
which is hidden from most people. She has the
power to see beyond the veil that hides from
mankind the mysteries of life. And now good-by.
Take this piece of bone and keep it as your
emblem of good luck. Have it mounted in silver
or gold and wear it as a charm on your watch
chain. It will be worth your while. That is all."</p>

<p>With a smile she entered the tent, and Dick
never saw her more; but he often had occasion
to remember her and her words of truth.</p>

<p>When Dick returned to the store at the beginning
of the new year he found he was promoted
to a regular position in the store proper, with an
increase of wages. His rise had been so far fairly
rapid, and was due to his natural abilities as
a salesman, his attractive personality and magnetic
ways, and his strict attention to his duties
and to the interests of his employer. His advancement
created no envy among the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
clerks, for they all liked him. He possessed all
the elements that make people popular with
those they come in contact with; and his power
extended over both sexes. Dick presided chiefly
over the silverware department, as he was more
familiar with that branch than the others.</p>

<p>He gradually extended his knowledge to
watches, and subsequently to jewelry, but the unset
diamond line was a special branch that required
an expert to deal with, and it was attended
to by one clerk only. This man was the head
of the jewelry department. His pay was much
higher than that of the other clerks, but then
his responsibilities, knowledge and experience
were greater than theirs. The days passed into
weeks, and the weeks resolved themselves into
months, and Easter week came around, bringing
its expected invitation to Dick to spend the
week-end with the Masons. He and Madge corresponded
regularly now, and the latest piece of
news he got from her was that she was slated
for Vassar College at the beginning of the fall
term. The four-year course would carry her into
her twentieth year. Dick would be twenty-two
then, if he lived, and he wondered if they would
still think as much of each other as they did
now.</p>

<p>So he went down to Carlin early on Saturday
afternoon and was met by the auto, with Madge
in it, and whirled over the road to the house.
They were just turning in at the gate when a
seedy, hard-featured man came along. He scowled
when his eyes rested on Dick's face, and then
the boy recognized him as Samuel Parker, one
of the two burglars who had robbed the Mason
house. His time, reduced by commutation for
good behavior, had just expired at the State prison,
and he had come back to his old stamping-grounds,
to find things about as he had left them.</p>

<p>His wife had managed to get along through the
sympathy of neighbors who had given her various
kinds of employment, and many of the farmers
occasionally chipped in a dollar apiece to help
her out when she was hard pressed. She kept a
cow, chickens, and raised her own vegetables, so
she did not fare so badly. Now that her husband
had returned, the question arose as to
whether he would be able to get any employment
on the farm where he had picked up odd jobs
before he got into trouble. Dick was surprised
to see him at liberty, not knowing that his sentence
had expired, and he called Madge's attention
to him.</p>

<p>"Yes, he's been around for about a week," she
said. "Father said his time was up."</p>

<p>"I see. He got a commutation of twenty
months. Well, he isn't as tough a nut as his
companion, who enticed him into the job. That
chap has three years and a half more to serve,
deducting his commutation. Then he will be arrested
as soon as he comes out and taken to New
York to answer to the indictment the district attorney
secured against him for assaulting me in
the sample room of our store and stealing $100
worth of our stock. He'll get another five years
at least for that, at Sing Sing. It will simply be
a change of prisons for him."</p>

<p>Dick inquired if the gypsies had taken their departure,
and Madge said she believed they had.</p>

<p>"This is the time that Miriam, the head of the
tribe, said I was going to come into a fortune
that she alleged I already possessed, but I don't
see any signs of the matter coming to pass yet,"
he said.</p>

<p>"I wonder what she meant by saying that you
possessed it. She must have referred to that
piece of land father gave you."</p>

<p>"That isn't money."</p>

<p>"You could realize money on it."</p>

<p>"Not over $400 at the most, and that is no fortune."</p>

<p>"Well, she told you so much that you say proved
true that I shall be surprised if she made a
mistake in this matter."</p>

<p>"I'll be surprised if she hit the truth, for coming
into a fortune in money is the very last thing
I dream of at this moment."</p>

<p>They got out of the auto and entered the house.
On the following day after dinner, as it was a
nice afternoon, Dick proposed to Madge that they
take a walk. So they went out and spent a couple
of hours strolling along the road. They passed
Dick's property and he saw that the gypsies
had gone away. On their way back he proposed
that they go over to the spring and have a drink.</p>

<p>"I'm not thirsty, but I'll go with you," she
said.</p>

<p>The fence rails were wide enough apart for her
to get through, while Dick took the customary
way and climbed over. The spring was down in
a gully near the fence which marked the end of
Dick's land in that direction, and taking a silver-plated
collapsible cup out of his pocket the boy
filled it and offered it to Madge. She took a
drink and then he helped himself. The young
trees, now well advanced, which we mentioned
before as growing at this end of Dick's property
were gradually forming a small wood that would
occupy about one acre of the five. On their way
back they walked through these trees, as Dick
was somewhat interested in their growth. They
were cedar trees and would ultimately make good
railroad ties.</p>

<p>"I wish the whole property was wooded like
this," he said. "I would in such a case make a
good thing out of the trees."</p>

<p>"As lumber?" said Madge.</p>

<p>"As railroad ties. Those articles are always in
demand. Hello!" he exclaimed, stopping, "here's
one of the old guard still standing."</p>

<p>He pointed at a hoary-looking old tree that
had been dead for years. It showed evidence of
having been struck by lightning a long time
since. This had killed it, and now it stood like
the mummified corpse of some old grizzled veteran
of many wars, its two withered arms pointing
heavenward at an acute angle that formed
the whole trunk into the shape of the letter Y.
Dick approached it and struck the tree with the
palm of his hand. It gave forth a hollow sound
and shook under the blow.</p>

<p>"That old monarch won't last much longer," he
said. "It feels as if a strong wind would blow it
over. It seems to be nothing but a shell, and yet
it looks as solid as a rock outside. It's funny
how some trees decay from the inside. I'm going
to climb up and see if there's an opening between
those limbs."</p>

<p>He started to do so, with the assistance of the
knobby projections, when he was surprised to
hear a noise inside the tree that made him suspect
some kind of an animal had taken refuge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
there. He kept on till his head rose above the
fork and he saw a great hole extending downward.
He was about to ask Madge to hand him
a long stick he saw lying on the ground, when,
to his astonishment, a rough voice floated upward.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Parker?" were the words that
reached his ears.</p>

<p>"Hello! Who are you?" cried Dick.</p>

<p>A muttered imprecation followed, and then silence.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" again asked Dick.</p>

<p>There was no reply. Dick climbed higher after
telling the surprised girl that there was a man
inside of the tree, pulled out his match safe and
flashed a light into the tree. He saw a slouched
hat, which evidently covered a head, and a pair
of broad shoulders.</p>

<p>"Come on now, I see you. What are you doing
in there?" said Dick.</p>

<p>"None of your business," replied a voice from
under the hat.</p>

<p>"Maybe it isn't, but it strikes me that you have
no business there. So you're a friend of Parker's,
eh? Birds of a feather flock together, they say,
so I guess you're not a very creditable sort of
individual. I'd like you to know that you're trespassing
on&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Trespassin' be jiggered! I'm just restin' here.
Go away and leave me alone."</p>

<p>"Not until I find out who you are. Your presence
in this hollow tree looks suspicious."</p>

<p>"What's suspicious about it? Can't a fellow
roost inside a tree if he wants to when he ain't
got nowhere else to go?"</p>

<p>Dick climbed down the tree and, taking Madge
by the arm, started off. There was a large rock
close by of sufficient size for a person to conceal
himself behind.</p>

<p>"You go on, Madge, a little way, and I'll follow
in a few minutes. I have an idea that fellow
will show himself presently to see if the
coast is clear, and I'm going to hide behind this
rock and catch a sight of him if he comes up."</p>

<p>The girl kept on at a slow pace and Dick
dropped on his hands and knees behind the stone.
Five minutes passed and nothing happened. Dick
was beginning to think that he had calculated
wrongly, when he saw the crown of a hat rise
between the fork of the two limbs. A face followed
the hat, a tough-looking face, and Dick
gave a gasp as he recognized it. It was the countenance
of Bulger, supposed to be serving the
rest of his time at the Trenton State prison.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII_The_Hidden_Treasure" id="CHAPTER_XIII_The_Hidden_Treasure">CHAPTER XIII.&mdash;The Hidden Treasure.</a></h2>


<p>Bulger looked around cautiously on every side,
and believing that the person who had discovered
him had gone away he sank back into his hiding
place.</p>

<p>Dick hastily rejoined Madge and told her about
the identity of the man in the tree. He also outlined
his plans for the rascal's arrest. They were
about to hurry to the house when Dick caught
sight of a figure slouching through the trees toward
the gully. He guessed it was Parker, and
he altered his arrangements.</p>

<p>"Parker is coming to see Bulger. There he is
yonder, just going down into the gully. I'm going
to remain and see what happens. You hurry
to the house and send John and William here as
fast as they can come. Tell them to fetch their
revolvers and a piece of rope. Now, then, Madge,
put your best foot forward."</p>

<p>She hastened away, while he crept back toward
the big rock. Parker was coming up the gully
with a package and a tin bucket in his hands.
Presumedly they held food for the escaped convict.
Dick gained the rock without attracting
Parker's attention. The ex-convict approached
the tree, laid his burdens on the ground and,
climbing up, stuck his head down the opening.
He remained a few minutes talking with the man
inside and then returned to the ground and carried
up first the package and then the pail, which
he passed down to Bulger. He remained at the
crotch talking to his pal. Suddenly there was a
cracking sound and the tree began to bend over.</p>

<p>Parker uttered an exclamation of alarm and
started to clamber down. His movements brought
matters to a head. The tree broke off at its roots
and went over, carrying the ex-convict with it.
As it hit the ground Dick saw a pair of legs,
which belonged to Bulger, kicking like mad in
the air. As they hit the roots of the tree they
made the punky material fly about in a cloud.
Parker was half-stunned for a moment and then
he got up and went to his companion's aid, catching
him by the legs and pulling him out, all covered
with dirt. Bulger swore like a trooper,
blaming his pal for the catastrophe.</p>

<p>"Where am I goin' to roost now?" said Bulger.
"You'll have to take me over to your place after
dark and let me stay in your barn. I can't stay
out here all night, and, what's more, I won't."</p>

<p>"I s'pose you'll have to come, but it's dangerous
for me."</p>

<p>"Dangerous be blamed! It's your duty to help
an old pal when he's in deep."</p>

<p>He gave the roots of the tree a kick, expressive
of his sentiments. The kick uncovered something
that attracted his attention.</p>

<p>"Hello! What's this?" he cried.</p>

<p>He stooped and picked a bag out of the dust.</p>

<p>"What have you got there?" asked Parker,
looking interested.</p>

<p>"Blame my hide, if it ain't a bag of money!"
cried Bulger.</p>

<p>"Money!" cried Parker. "Then we'll divvy up."</p>

<p>"No, we won't divvy nothin'. Findin's is keepin's.
I wonder if there's any more?"</p>

<p>Down he got on his hands and knees and
scratched in the dust, bringing to light a second
bag.</p>

<p>"Hurray! Another! I'm made for fair. Here's
a third and there's more underneath. I'm rich!"</p>

<p>Dick beheld all this with feelings of the greatest
astonishment. Bags of money hidden in the
roots of the dead tree! Then the gypsy woman's
prediction occurred to him like a flash. This was
his fortune, then, and these rascals had brought
it to light. What was on his property belonged
to him by right of ownership in all. And now
these fellows had it in their clutches, or rather
Bulger had it, and seemed disposed to hold on to
all of it. That was too much for Dick to stand.
He was about to rush on Bulger and order him
to give up the money when Parker snatched up a
couple of the bags.</p>

<p>"Drop them!" roared Bulger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm only takin' my share," said Parker.</p>

<p>Bulger sprang up and jumped at the ex-convict,
who had to let the bags fall to defend himself.
In another moment they were both at it,
hammer-and-tongs, with the advantage in Bulger's
favor, owing to his build and strength. Dick
saw his advantage. Dashing forward, he picked
up the long stick which lay on the ground and
began laying it on the heads and shoulders of
the two fighters. That brought the scrap to a
sudden end, and the men turned to face this new
and unexpected trouble. They at once recognized
Dick, and as they bore him no good will, Bulger
particularly, they lost no time in making a rush
at him.</p>

<p>"Now we've got you!" hissed Bulger.</p>

<p>At that critical moment for Dick the gardener
and the footman came on the scene and sprang
to the boy's assistance. The gardener seized
Bulger and the footman nabbed Parker, compelling
them to release Dick. The boy then assisted
the gardener in securing the escaped convict, and
they had their hands full doing it. The butler
was able to subdue Parker alone. Bulger was
bound with the rope, and he was furious at his
capture, not to speak of the loss of the money he
believed he had come into. The young New
Yorker then called the attention of the butler and
the gardener to the bags of money lying on the
ground.</p>

<p>"They came out of the roots of that tree, and
as this property is mine, the money is mine, too,
unless somebody can establish a mighty strong
claim to it. It has evidently been hidden there
for a great many years. The person who put it
there is doubtless dead, else he would have reclaimed
it long ago. I shall take charge of it
by right of ownership in the property," said Dick,
who at once set about gathering together the six
bags Bulger had brought to light, while the ruffian
hurled imprecations at him as he watched
him. Dick then hunted for more, and found six
additional bags. The weight of the whole was
more than even the three of them could carry,
had they not been embarrassed by the two prisoners,
so Dick told the men to take the rascals
to the house and lock them up while he would
remain in charge of the money.</p>

<p>Then came a fresh difficulty. Bulger refused to
walk.</p>

<p>"Return to the house, William, and get Mr.
Mason to telephone to the village for the constables,"
said Dick. "I'll see that Parker doesn't
get away."</p>

<p>So the butler departed on his errand. He was
back in twenty minutes, accompanied by Mr. Mason
and a neighboring farmer, who had called at
the house. The prisoners were taken to the road
where the automobile stood. Then the twelve
bags of money were carried and put in the vehicle.
Leaving the two servants to walk, the
rest of the party proceeded to the house in the
vehicle. Bulger and Parker were locked up in
an outhouse to await the arrival of the constable,
while the money was taken into the house and
displayed before the astonished eyes of the ladies.</p>

<p>The money-bags were then opened and found
to contain gold eagles of a date about the time
of the War of the Rebellion, and being counted
footed up $120,000.</p>

<p>"What a lucky boy you are!" Madge said to
him, after supper.</p>

<p>"I hope I am," he replied.</p>

<p>"Hope!" she exclaimed, in surprise. "Why, you
are, with all that money."</p>

<p>"There is something better than money. Something
I'd rather have than all the gold I have
come in possession of."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"It's your love, Madge," he replied earnestly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dick!" she cried blushingly.</p>

<p>"Have I got it, or have I dreamed in vain?"</p>

<p>He put his arm around her waist and she did
not draw back. Dick did not return to New York
by the early train on Monday morning, as he
had arranged to do, instead of which he went to
Carlin with Mr. Mason in the auto and placed
the money in the Carlin National Bank, receiving
therefor a draft on a bank in New York for
the amount. Then he sent off two telegrams&mdash;one
to the manager of the store, the other to his
mother. The first read: "Will report Tuesday
morning."</p>

<p>The second was worded: "I've found the fortune.
Will be home to-night in time for dinner."
Then he returned to the house to take lunch with
the Masons. On the road he confessed to Mr.
Mason that he loved Madge, and that she reciprocated
his affection.</p>

<p>"I want you to sanction our engagement, with
a view to our marriage as soon as she shall have
graduated from Vassar."</p>

<p>"Ask her mother, my boy," said the gentleman.
"As far as I am concerned, you need fear no obstacle
from me."</p>

<p>While they were away, Madge sought her
mother and told her that Dick had asked her to
marry him four years hence when she had completed
her education. Then Mrs. Mason kissed
her daughter and told her that she and Mr. Mason
were both well disposed toward Dick, and
they were perfectly satisfied to receive him into
the family at the proper time as their son-in-law.</p>

<p>Then the happy girl ran and broke the news
to her aunt, who congratulated her on winning
such a fine young man as she had always believed
Dick Darling to be. Dick decided not to press
any charge against Parker, and so that rascal
was allowed to go free, while Bulger was taken
back to Trenton, and his punishment for taking
French leave was the loss of his commutation
time, so he was obliged to serve the full ten
years, after which he would have to face the
other indictment, so his chances of staying in
prison for a good part of his life were good.</p>

<p>During the summer the Darlings moved into a
house of their own in the Bronx, and Nellie and
May gave up their jobs for good. So four years
passed away and Dick continued to rise in the
store till one day Mr. Bacon offered to sell him
a half interest in the business, and make him the
manager of the store. Dick accepted his proposal,
and thus, on the eve of his marriage to
Madge he invested a large part of the fortune
which came to him through the acquisition of a
five-acre plot of ground worth not over $250.</p>

<h3>JANITOR AN HEIR.</h3>

<p>Charles Wineland, an $8 a month janitor at
the City Hall, Fort Wayne, Ind., leaned on the
handle of his broom long enough to read a letter
the other day and then a few hours later started
for California to claim a 114-acre fruit farm on
the outskirts of San Francisco and $28,000 deposited
in a bank there. The letter informed him
that his brother had died leaving his estate to the
janitor and a sister, Mrs. Caroline Bowman, of
Burlington, Ind. The farm is appraised for taxation
at $78,000, according to the letter.</p>


<h3>SETS HIMSELF ON FIRE.</h3>

<p>Pedro Sacherelli, a boy in the eighth grade in
the Little Falls, N. Y., High School, was sitting
at his desk, wiggling, as boys do. Another boy,
sitting near him, saw a column of smoke ascending
along Pedro's backbone and circling toward
the ceiling. A quick look revealed the fact that
matches in Pedro's pocket had been rubbed violently
enough to set them on fire.</p>

<p>Other pupils and the teacher jumped to the
rescue and Pedro's sweater was jerked off, the
fire beat out and the small boy returned to his
seat. A considerable hole was burned through
Pedro's clothes and he was not hurt, though the
fire extinguishers shook him up considerably.</p>


<h3>MUSICAL PITCHFORKS IN SOUTH AFRICA.</h3>

<p>A tale comes out of England which illustrates
admirably the sort of unexpected demand which
may have to be met in building up a foreign
trade. A British manufacturer of edge tools
made up his mind to secure a share of the trade
in Kaffir picks, and obtained a sample of the
native-made pick, which he reproduced so exactly
that it seemed to be impossible to detect the difference
between it and the native article. His
tools, however, did not sell, and a representative
was sent out to investigate. He found there was
one thing for which the Kaffir used the pick that
had not been taken into consideration. The native
took it out of its haft and used it as a cattle
call, and every Kaffir had found that the British-made
pick had not quite the right note. It speaks
well for the enterprise of the maker that, having
discovered this, he produced a Kaffir pick with
the right note and established a trade which, the
story goes, he has retained ever since.</p>


<h3>A PARIS HOLD-UP.</h3>

<p>Paris Apaches, imitating their New York
brothers, got away with one of the most daring
robberies in the history of the city, carrying off
500,000 francs' worth of jewels from a shop in
the center of the town and distancing their pursuers
after an exciting motor car chase.</p>

<p>About 9 o'clock in the evening a policeman
passing across the street from a jewelry shop in
the Rue Tronchet running from the Place de la
Madeleine to the Boulevard Haussmann saw a
man deliberately break a window of the store
with a hammer, seize a tray of jewels and jump
into a car, which drove away at high speed. The
gendarme succeeded in getting on the running
board of the car, but was pushed off by the robber.
The thief fired twice at him. The policeman
commandeered a passing taxi and began a vain
chase, for the bandit's car disappeared in a network
of side streets.</p>


<h3>SCORES OF GIRLS LOSE $50.</h3>

<p>Dreams of becoming cinema stars are being
shattered in the minds of scores of girls throughout
the Middle West as a result of the bursting
of an alleged promotion bubble in Kansas City,
Mo., known as the International Pictures Corporation.</p>

<p>The scheme, according to Federal officers, was
simple. An advertisement in an Eastern theatrical
magazine asked for chorus girls and leads.
On beautifully engraved stationery, the applicants
were told of a trip to California, a chartered
yacht that was to sail the South Seas, drop anchor
in Egypt and cruise European waters. The only
requisite was a deposit of $50 to "keep away curiosity
seekers."</p>

<p>The money came with answers such as the following:</p>

<p>"I am five feet four and very pretty. Inclosed
is $50."</p>

<p>Then along came the agents of the post-office
department and spoiled the plan. Hubert Settles
and his wife were arrested. Post-office inspectors
say they have scores of the letters from girls.</p>


<h3>NAVY RECRUITING STOPPED.</h3>

<p>Secretary of the Navy Daniels announced on
January 4 that recruiting for the Navy has been
stopped for the present, the enlisted strength having
reached 132,000. The naval appropriations
for the current fiscal year were made to take care
of the pay of an average of 120,000 enlisted men.
By expiration of enlistments the number soon
will drop to about 122,000, which will give the
Navy an average of 120,000 for the fiscal year
ending June 30. One reason for the action is uncertainty
as to the number of enlisted men Congress
will authorize for the next fiscal year. Navy
authorities have recommended 143,000. Another
reason is found in the fact that the U. S. Atlantic
and Pacific Fleets soon will sail for their rendezvous
at the Pacific entrance to the Panama Canal.
It was not deemed desirable to go ahead with
further enlistments with most of the active ships
in distant waters. Although the Marine Corps
has not suspended recruiting, the standard has
been raised, requiring a minimum of twenty-one
years of age, five feet five inches height, and 130
pounds weight. The quota for January has been
cut to 1,400 and this low figure will keep the enlisted
personnel of the corps within the average
of 20,000 for the fiscal year 1921 for which appropriations
are available. Two-year enlistments
have been suspended, and recruits confined to a
choice of enlisting for either three or four years.</p>

<p>And then the busy lawyer caught up his satchel
and started out of the office to catch his train.
Lew opened the bundle of papers, and was soon
studying them hard.</p>

<p>He had tried minor court cases, but had never
had one in the supreme court, and he felt that it
was rather unkind of fate that the first one that
came to him to try in the upper court was regarded
by even his shrewd employer as quite
hopeless. However, he bent himself to the task,
reflecting over the one saving point of the week
that Smollett had worked, and trying to decide
just how to make that fact effective.</p>

<p>Just as he had made up his mind what course
to pursue about it, the telephone rang, and he was
notified that the case was called and that the
office boy had answered ready.</p>

<p>Stuffing the papers in his pocket, Lew walked
over to the courthouse, thinking deeply over the
idea that had come into his mind. He got there
just as the jury box was filled, and eyed them
narrowly while the counsel for the plaintiff was examining
them. It looked like a good sensible
jury to him, and he made but two objections to the
men in the box.</p>

<p>The jury was sworn and the case opened.</p>

<p>Smollett's lawyer told how the accident had
happened, and then drew a touching picture of
how the plaintiff's wife, a sickly looking woman
who sat at his side in court, had slaved to support
the family, Smollett being unable to work,
and not having done a day's work since the time
he was injured. Lew cast down his eyes when
this statement was made, and began to feel a
little more hopeful.</p>

<p>Then Smollett was put on the stand and told
his story, moaned about the constant pain that he
had suffered since he was hurt, while the jury
began to look sympathetic. In response to the
questioning of his lawyer he declared that he had
not been able to do more than to sweep a room
since the day of the accident. Then Lew arose
to cross-examine him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Smollett, what was your business before
you were injured?"</p>

<p>"I was an iron worker."</p>

<p>"That requires great strength, does it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it does."</p>

<p>"All parts of the work?"</p>

<p>"Yes, all parts of the work."</p>

<p>"And you could do any part of the work?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I was a pretty powerful man."</p>

<p>"And you have not been able to do anything
more laborious than to sweep a room since you
were injured?"</p>

<p>"That is true."</p>

<p>"How long have you lived in this city?"</p>

<p>"Three years."</p>

<p>"Where did you live before you came here?"</p>

<p>"In Far Rockton."</p>

<p>"At what address?"</p>

<p>"Two-forty-one Vine street."</p>

<p>"How long did you live there?"</p>

<p>"Four months."</p>

<p>"Where did you move to when you came to this
city?"</p>

<p>"One-seventy-two Bear street."</p>

<p>"How long did you live there?"</p>

<p>"Six weeks. The house was cold and we could
not stay there."</p>

<p>Lew bent down and selected a paper, glanced
at it as though to refresh his memory, and then
went on with the examination.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="center">The Result of the Young Lawyer's Keen Management
of the Smollett Case.</p>


<p>"Where did you move to then?"</p>

<p>"Seventy-nine-eight Locust street."</p>

<p>"How long did you live there?"</p>

<p>"Only three weeks. The plumbing was bad."</p>

<p>Lew kept on in this line of questioning for several
minutes more, by which time Smollett had
testified that he had moved thirteen times during
the past three years, in each instance telling the
address of the house he had lived in and the
length of time he had lived there.</p>

<p>"This is astonishing," said Lew. "You certainly
possess a remarkable memory, Mr. Smollett."</p>

<p>"I think I have got a good memory," complacently
said the witness.</p>

<p>"There is no question about that," said Lew.
"I very much doubt if any gentleman on the jury
could have remembered so much and so positively
as you have done, and yet you have apparently
forgotten that you worked for the Continental
Iron Works for one entire week since the date of
your accident!"</p>

<p>A murmur of surprise went around the crowded
courtroom. The witness grew pale and then
flushed fiery red, and shifted uneasily in his seat,
while the members of the jury glanced at each
other in a significant manner.</p>

<p>Smollett's lawyer half arose as though to make
some objection, and then seemed to realize the
hopeless nature of the situation and sat down
again with a scowl on his face.</p>

<p>The witness was trembling, and Lew went at
him savagely.</p>

<p>"I have here a sworn copy of the time-book of
the Continental Iron Works, in which your name
appears as having worked from the seventh to the
thirteenth of June in the year you were injured,"
he said, fixing the unhappy witness with his piercing
eyes. "Do you deny that you did that work?"</p>

<h3>"NO JOB; NO BRIDE."</h3>

<p>The extent and the effect of unemployment in
Detroit was shown recently when it was learned
that twenty-six bridegrooms have recently returned
their marriage licenses to the county clerk.
All gave the same reason: "No job, no wedding,"
they said.</p>


<h3>BABY OSTRICH SCRAPPY.</h3>

<p>Jonathan, the first ostrich chick hatched in
Canada, is progressing under the care of Zoo
Manager F. Green in Stanley Park, Vancouver.
It was at first believed that the rare and valuable
bird would not live, and it was taken from its
parents and placed in the Green home. Appearance
of weakness proved deceptive, for Jonathan
quickly whipped the house cat and won a decision
over the family spaniel.</p>


<h3>CRACKS SAFE, GETS 16 CENTS.</h3>

<p>William Redke, forty years old, with no permanent
residence, out of employment and broke, is in
the Washington County jail, Pennsylvania, a confessed
burglar and attempted suicide. Redke's
cracking of the safe in the Pennsylvania Station
at Houston the other night, he told the authorities,
netted him but 16 cents. Discouraged over
the small haul, he turned on all the gas in the
station office. Five hours later he awoke still in
the land of the living. In disgust he surrendered
to the officers. He pleaded guilty and was committed
to jail in default of $1,000 bail.</p>


<h3>WHERE DO SEALS SPEND THE WINTER?</h3>

<p>No one knows where the seals go in the winter.
In Alaska they begin to appear on the Islands of
St. Paul and St. George about the end of April or
the first of May, and toward the latter part of
August or in the first weeks of September they
disappear as strangely and mysteriously as they
came. This is one of nature's secrets which she
has kept most successfully hid from scientists as
well as the prying eyes of the merely curious and
inquisitive.</p>

<p>Even in the days, years ago, when the seals
numbered five millions or more, apparently some
signal unknown to man would be given and the
next day the fog-wreathed rocks would be bare,
the seals having deserted the islands. With their
slipping off into Bering Sea, all trace of them
was lost until their return the following spring.
Then some morning they would suddenly reappear,
disporting themselves in the water or on the
shore.</p>


<h3>ABOUT SCENTED WOODS.</h3>

<p>With the woods of the world to choose from
one can easily arrange a whole scale of scents
from the sweetest and most delicate of perfumes
at one extreme to rank and overpowering odors
at the other, says the American Forestry Magazine.
The stores of the perfumer's shop will not
yield a greater variety than one can find in woods.</p>

<p>The most famous of all scented woods is the
incomparable sandalwood. The true sandalwood
(Santalum album) is an Oriental tree, the use of
which for perfumery and incense began thousands
of years ago, and its popularity remains undiminished.
The later Greeks considered it one of
their greatest luxuries, and no festivities were
complete without it. There are many false sandalwoods,
at least three from India, one or two
from the Philippines and Java, one from Australia
and another from the West Indies and
Venezuela.</p>

<p>In some parts of the Himalayas and in the
Khasia Hills the yew tree is called deodar (God's
tree), the name that is elsewhere applied to a
true cedar. The wood of the yew is burnt as incense,
as is also that of the cypress. One of the
favorite woods for incense in the Buddhist temples
of India is the juniper. In parts of South
America a wood closely related to the lignum-vitae
is called palo santo (sacred wood), because
of its use for incense in churches.</p>

<p>The Northwestern Indians nearly always made
their totem poles out of Western red cedar, but
this choice was probably due more to the fact
that the wood is easy to work and extremely
durable rather than to its fragrance. It may be
taken as a very good general rule that woods that
are scented are resistant to decay and insect attack
and have good cabinet qualities.</p>

<p>"Then you will not listen to me?"</p>

<p>"No. I believe you to be a wicked man, and I
will never consent to sacrifice my child to such
as you."</p>

<p>"But if she loves me?"</p>

<p>"She does not&mdash;she cannot! She knows your
evil reputation, and her heart is another's."</p>

<p>"I will wait. She loves me, and will be mine. I
am sure of it."</p>

<p>"Never! And now, as we have already prolonged
this meeting beyond reason, go, and never
speak to me on the subject again."</p>

<p>"Very well, Giles Raynor, I shall not. I shall
speak to your daughter instead."</p>

<p>"Do so at your peril, Tom Walden! Now go!"</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Farmer Raynor, and a better
temper to you when we meet again."</p>

<p>The man whose suit had been refused went
away with a smile upon his dark face, and without
the least threat against his rival, or the man
who had given him his dismissal, nor the least
suggestion that he meant otherwise than to honestly
win the girl whom he professed to love.</p>

<p>Giles Raynor was a settler in the far Northwest,
and a man of importance in the little town
which he had founded.</p>

<p>Tom Walden had come among the settlers
within a year, and had affected a great liking for
Grace Raynor, the farmer's daughter, and had
asked for her hand in marriage.</p>

<p>Walden claimed to be a lumberman, but there
were those who said that he had come into this
lonely region to get ahead of an evil reputation,
and although he might be what he avowed, he
was no honest man seeking to make a living in
these wilds.</p>

<p>It was said, although not too openly, that Tom
Walden was a gambler and a thief; that he had
fled to escape punishment for his crimes, and that
even now, in his new home, he was not above suspicion,
and that many had been made victims of
his unscrupulous methods.</p>

<p>Grace Raynor had expressed an open dislike to
him, and was reported to be engaged to marry
Jack Woodson, an honest young fellow at work in
the sawmill in town, the only support of a
widowed mother, and as free-hearted, generous-handed
a young man as one could meet.</p>

<p>No one knew definitely if the young people were
engaged, for they kept their own counsel, and
when slyly questioned about the matter replied
that people would know all about it as soon as it
became necessary for them to do so.</p>

<p>Tom Walden left the farmer's house, ostensibly
to go to work in the woods, and Giles Raynor
gave little thought to him, having other matters
to occupy his mind.</p>

<p>He left his daughter to look after the house, as
usual, when he went into the fields, saying nothing
to her about Walden's proposal, not deeming
it necessary to worry her.</p>

<p>When he came home at noon his wife said that
Grace had gone to another town to make some
purchases, being unable to obtain what she
wanted in their own village, expecting to return
by the middle of the afternoon.</p>

<p>When evening came she had not returned, and
the farmer began to feel a vague alarm concerning
her, although Walden had uttered no threats
against her, or any one in whom she was interested.</p>

<p>At nightfall a boy brought a note to the farmer,
saying that it had been given him by a woman
closely veiled, an hour before, on the extreme
verge of the town.</p>

<p>The note read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Dear Father: I have gone away with the man
I love&mdash;Tom Walden. Do not pursue us, for we
will not be brought back alive. By the time you
receive this we will be married.</p>

<p class="right">
"GRACE."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The farmer handed the note to his wife, his
face expressing the astonishment he felt.</p>

<p>"It is not true," said Mrs. Raynor. "Grace told
me only this noon that she loved Jack Woodson,
and that they intended to be married in the fall,
but that they did not want it generally known just
yet."</p>

<p>"Then this scoundrel Walden has carried her
off!" cried the farmer.</p>

<p>"Grace never wrote that letter," said the wife.
"She is a truthful girl, and has told me often that
she never loved any one but Jack, and to-day, as
I told you, she said that she and Jack had fixed
on the day for their wedding."</p>

<p>The farmer took the note, put on his glasses,
and read it again, more carefully.</p>

<p>"It's her handwriting, as sure as I sit here,"
he said; "but that scoundrel has made her write
it, and has carried her off."</p>

<p>"Grace would die sooner than write a lie," said
the mother.</p>

<p>At that moment Jack Woodson entered the
room.</p>

<p>"Where is Grace? What is this story I hear?"
he asked excitedly.</p>

<p>The farmer handed him the note, which he read
hurriedly and then tossed upon the floor.</p>

<p>"It's a lie! a false, cruel lie!" he cried. "My
darling never wrote that&mdash;never could write it.
It's the work of that villain, Walden. Do you
know what I have just heard? Tom Walden was
arrested on a charge of forgery in Chicago&mdash;would
have gone to prison, for his conviction was
certain, but jumped his bail, and fled. His name
is not Walden at all. There is a man at the hotel
who knows all about him, and described him this
very hour. More than that, there is an old indictment
against him in New York for murder.
The plea was self-defence, and the case never
came to trial. Now they have new evidence that
he deliberately murdered the man. He was then
known as Tom Walden. My Grace run away with
a man like that! Never! He has carried her
off, and has written this note himself to deceive
us. He has stolen her, but I will pursue him and
bring her back, if I have to kill him to do it!"</p>

<p>Then, without further words, he rushed from
the house into the darkness.</p>

<p>The next morning he had disappeared, and no
one knew where he had gone, nor for months did
the settlers hear tidings of him or of Grace or of
Tom Walden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>In one of the wildest parts of the Northwest
woods an Indian village had been built.</p>

<p>There were no white settlers within many miles,
and the tribe was said to be a peaceful one, never
going on the warpath, and always treating with
kindness the few straggling whites who made
their way into this wilderness.</p>

<p>In one of the larger lodges of the village, one
pleasant afternoon in the late autumn, were a
man of about forty and a girl not much over
twenty.</p>

<p>The girl's complexion was fair, and she had
none of the characteristics of the Indian, although
dressed like one.</p>

<p>The man was tall and swarthy, with long, black
hair, which hung straight down upon his broad
shoulders, his face was cruel and crafty, and his
every look was evil.</p>

<p>He was dressed in half-savage, half-civilized
style, wearing a fur cap, an embroidered hunting-shirt
of buckskin, woolen trousers, heavy boots,
and a red sash in which were thrust a brace of
pistols and a knife.</p>

<p>"See here, Grace," he said to the girl who sat
before him on a low couch of skins, "I haven't
brought you here for nothing, and you must be
my wife."</p>

<p>"Never, Tom Walden, or whatever your evil
name is," said the girl. "Far from home and
friends, among these wild and savage men, less
pitiless than you are, I can still defy you. I will
never be your wife!"</p>

<p>"These people are my allies," said Walden. "I
have inflamed them against the whites, and they
are ready to go on the warpath if I bid them.
They will kill you as soon as any one, if I give
the word, and I will if you do not consent to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never!" cried Grace, springing to her feet. "I
doubt not that you have told many lies to account
for my disappearance, since you dragged me from
my home by your baseness. You are false enough
to make war against your own people, but I do
not fear you, no matter what you threaten. Kill
me, if you will, and release me from my misery!"</p>

<p>"I've a mind to take you at your word!" cried
Walden, seizing the girl by the wrist and raising
his knife as if to strike.</p>

<p>The maiden never flinched; but at that moment
an Indian youth sprang into the lodge and
threw himself between the renegade and the girl.</p>

<p>"White man no strike the white flower!" he
cried.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" growled the man, looking fixedly
at the youth.</p>

<p>"Me Young Elk. Me live far off, me come to
village, me have friend."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Young Elk, this is my squaw, and
you will take yourself off and mind your&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Paleface lie! The white flower is not his
squaw!" the young Indian replied.</p>

<p>"Get out of here!" hissed the renegade.</p>

<p>"No! Young Elk stay. White flower need
friend. Me be her friend."</p>

<p>"Blame you!" hissed Walden. "We'll see if any
mere boy can defy me! Out of the way, dog!"</p>

<p>"No," said the Indian. "Not while white flower
stay. Young Elk be friend to white woman; bad
paleface shall not strike."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my friend, but I fear him not,"
said Grace.</p>

<p>"I will conquer you yet!" hissed the renegade,
as he rushed from the lodge, the Indian boy having
stepped aside.</p>

<p>As soon as Walden had gone, Grace left the
lodge and hurried into the forest, where she ran
on till she reached a pool of water which made
its way swiftly into a cave amid the great ledges
of rock.</p>

<p>The spot was at some distance from the village,
the trees grew thick and high, and the path between
them was narrow and winding, and easily
lost; but the girl had evidently been there before,
for when she reached the opening in front of the
pool she looked around her with an air of security.</p>

<p>Walden, leaving the lodge, went to the chiefs,
whom he found gathered in council.</p>

<p>"Who is Young Elk?" demanded Walden.</p>

<p>"He is my kinsman," said one of the chiefs.</p>

<p>"He is a meddler!" snarled the renegade. "I
will kill him if he does not take care!"</p>

<p>"No, False Heart will not!" cried the old chief.
"False Heart lies, he has told crooked tales of the
paleface, he is a bad man. He would make us go
on the warpath when the whites have not wronged
us. It is he who will have to take care lest
Young Elk kill him!"</p>

<p>Inflamed with rage, Walden left the council and
hurried into the forest. As he hurried along the
narrow path he was followed by Young Elk.</p>

<p>Reaching the opening, Walden found Grace
upon her knees at the edge of the pool. "I cannot
bear to leave this bright world," she murmured,
"but I could not bear the disgrace, the
shame of being that man's wife! Oh! why is
there no one to help me?"</p>

<p>"Die, if you will have it so!" cried the renegade,
raising his hand to strike.</p>

<p>Upon the instant, the young Indian who had
been trailing him, sprang forward, seized the
renegade by the throat and hurled him into the
pool.</p>

<p>"Grace, my darling!" he cried, taking the girl
in his strong grasp and drawing her away.</p>

<p>"Jack! You!" she cried. "Then you are Young
Elk?"</p>

<p>"No; he is my friend. He it was who found
you here in the village, and told me, and none
too soon. I have sought you in many places.
The Indian boy who gave your father the letter
forged by Walden confessed that the villain had
taken you to some tribe far away, and I began
my search. I went from tribe to tribe, finding
you not, and at last met Young Elk, whose life I
saved. He went with me from village to village,
making inquiries, and here at last he found you.
But what has become of that scoundrel?"</p>

<p>"The strong current must have carried him into
yonder cave," said Grace. "The Indians say the
stream never issues forth after leaving the light."</p>

<p>"Then the scoundrel has met his just reward
for all his crimes," said Jack. "Come, I have
found you, and now we will return, never to be
parted again."</p>

<p>It is needless to say that Grace's parents were
overjoyed at her safe return, and on the appointed
day Jack and Grace became man and
wife.</p>

<h3>GETS FOUR BEARS.</h3>

<p>Albert Forney of White Rapids, Wis., shot four
bears recently. While out hunting he discovered
a cub in what proved to be a winter den. He
shot the cub and brought the mother charging
down upon him. Another shot finished her.
Forney then dispatched the two remaining cubs.
Father Bruin escaped by flight.</p>


<h3>CARRIED AN ARSENAL.</h3>

<p>Hilary Smith of Brooklyn was sent to jail the
other day for six months and fined $35 on charges
of carrying concealed weapons, drunkenness and
disorderly conduct. Smith, who said he was a
longshoreman, carried three big revolvers, three
razors, two dirk knives, 200 rounds of ammunition,
a marked deck of cards, a pair of loaded dice
and two half pints of whisky. He was arrested
at the Union Station, Washington, D. C., by detectives,
who noticed the bulges in his clothing.</p>

<p>"I was getting along all right in New York
and Brooklyn," he said in court, "until those cops
up there got too inquisitive and I had to leave.
Just the same I am a harmless man."</p>


<h3>WILD DOG ATTACKS MAN.</h3>

<p>Running wild for two years, after being lost in
the wilds of the Indian Creek Valley, Pa., by a
Pittsburgh hunter, an Airedale dog attacked and
injured James C. Munson, a well-known Connelsville
man, who was hunting in that section of the
country.</p>

<p>It was with difficulty that Munson beat off the
dog, which tore his clothing and flesh in several
places.</p>

<p>Only the whine of pups near by prevented Munson
from killing the canine. Nine pups about six
weeks old were taken by members of a posse
which went into the mountains when the attack
was reported by Munson. The mother dog was
not seen, but hunters who have encountered the
animal say she is as savage as any wolf they ever
saw.</p>


<h3>WHY CAN'T WE SEE IN THE DARK?</h3>

<p>We cannot see in the dark because there is no
light to see by. To understand this we must first
understand that when we see a thing, as we generally
say, we do not actually see the thing itself,
but only the light coming from it. But we have
become so used to saying that we see the thing
itself that for all practical purposes we can accept
that as true, although it is not scientifically
exact. Scientifically speaking, we see that part of
the sunlight or other light which is shining upon
it which the object is able to reflect.</p>

<p>If there were no air about us, we could not hear
any sounds, no matter how much disturbance people
or things created, because it requires air to
cause the sound waves which produce sound, and
air also to carry the sound waves to our ears. In
the same way, if there is no light to produce light
rays from any given object to our eyes, we can
see nothing. It requires light waves to produce
the reflections of objects to our eyes. Without
light our eyes and their delicate organs are useless.
You cannot see yourself in a mirror when
the quicksilver which was once on the back of the
glass has been removed, because there is then
nothing to reflect the light. We can only see
things when there is light enough about to reflect
things to our eyes. When it is dark there is no
light, and that is the reason we cannot see anything
in the dark.&mdash;Book of Wonders.</p>

<h3>CAT SAVED BY DOG.</h3>

<p>Judson T. Logan, of Leverette, Mass., and members
of his family overlooked the family cat,
"Chum," when they made a hurried escape from
their burning home the other day. But "Ted,"
their big St. Bernard, remembered.</p>

<p>The dog discovered the absence of his playmate,
rushed back through the smoke and soon
reappeared with "Chum" in his mouth.</p>

<p>Incidentally the Logans, as well as the other
occupants of another apartment in the house gave
the dog credit for awakening them by barking, so
they reached the street before their escape was
cut off by the flames.</p>


<h3>OVERPOPULATION.</h3>

<p>A remarkable case of overpopulation is that of
the Island of Bukara, in Lake Victoria Nyanza, described
by H. L. Duke in the Cornhill Magazine.
This island, with an area of 36 square miles, much
of which is bare granite, though isolated from the
rest of the world, supports a population of 19,000.
The small garden plots are carefully marked off
and rights of ownership are rigidly observed.
Trees are valued more than the land on which
they grow. In some cases one man owns the trees
and another the ground. A man must not steal his
neighbor's leaves, sticks and rubbish. A father
may even divide a tree among his children, allotting
certain branches to each.</p>


<h3>FINDS A REAL PARADISE.</h3>

<p>Thomas Kelley, a farmhand in Paradise, Kan.,
60 years old, has just received a present that belonged
to anybody until a few days ago.</p>

<p>Kelley has been working in this community as
a farmhand for some years. Near Paradise is
the Worley ranch, consisting of several thousand
acres. It has been the opinion of all that Worley
owned all the land. Kelley began an investigation
and discovered that eighty acres near the
center of the ranch never had been homesteaded.</p>

<p>He immediately took up the matter with the
Topeka land office and is now practically the
owner of the farm, worth approximately $5,000.
The land is in the heart of a rich and fertile valley,
noted for raising wheat. Most of the farm
is under cultivation.</p>

<p>Kelley will improve the land at once and will
erect a house to live in.</p>


<h3>GIRLS MUST COVER KNEES.</h3>

<p>Girl students at the Randolph-Macon Institute,
part of the Southern Methodist institution, Danville,
Va., have been told in blunt terms they must
wear their stockings as their mothers taught
them and not in conformity with fashion's
latest edict, which provides for the rolling process
and knee lengths.</p>

<p>From sources of unquestioned authority comes
word that within the last few days the faculty
of teachers were called together and served what
was little short of an ultimatum to the student
body. Failure to comply will be met with severe
reprisals.</p>

<p>It is alleged and not contradicted, that certain
young sophomores who cling to college traditions
have been "rolling their own" with ruthless disregard
to feet and meters. The students have
accepted the order with philosophy.</p>

<h3>Shows Clear Pictures</h3>

<p>I have been very slow in sending
you an answer. I received
my Moving Picture Machine a
few weeks ago and I think it is
a dandy, and it shows the pictures
clear just as you said it
would. I am very proud of it.
I thank you very much for it
and I am glad to have it. I
gave an entertainment two
days after I got it. Leopold
Lamontagne, 54 Summer Ave.,
Central Falls. R. I.</p>


<h3>Sold His for $10.00
and Ordered Another</h3>

<p>Some time ago I got one of
your Machines and I am very
much pleased with it. After
working it for about a month I
sold it for $10.00 to a friend of
mine. He has it and entertains
his family nightly. I have now
decided to get another one of
your machines. Michael
Ehereth, Mandan, N. Dak.</p>


<h3>Would Not Give Away
for $25.00</h3>

<p>My Moving Picture Machine
is a good one and I would not
give it away for $25.00. It's
the best machine I ever had and
I wish everybody could have
one. Addie Bresky, Jeanesville,
Pa. Box 34.</p>


<h3>Better Than a $12.00
Machine</h3>

<p>I am slow about turning in my
thanks to you, but my Moving
Picture Machine is all right. I
have had it a long time and it
has not been broken yet. I
have seen a $12.00 Machine but
would not swap mine for it.

<h3>BOYS SETTLE

times to enable
the combatants
to rest and
rinse out their
mouths, and after
fifteen minutes
Salvatore had an
unquestioned decision.</p>

<p>"Letting the
boys fight out
their troubles is
the best way in
a school such as
the Webster,"
said Miss Hogge.
"Of course, the
fights must be
fair.</p>

<p>"I never permit
any serious
injuries. A black
eye or two, such
as Abe got, is usually
the limit."</p>

<p>J. C. Mortensen,
superintendent
of schools,
declared he was
in favor of Miss
Hogge's method,
saying it is the
most successful
ever tried in that
school.</p>




<h3><a name="MONT_BLANC" id="MONT_BLANC">MONT BLANC
LOSES TOP.</a></h3>


<p>The top of
Mont Blanc fell
off November 26
and started an
enormous avalanche,
which
rolled down into
Italy along the
gorge of the
Brenva Glacier,
destroying in its
course the whole
forest of Pourtud.</p>

<p>The origin of
the avalanche was
unknown till yesterday,
when the
weather cleared,
and a powerful
telescope could
be brought to
bear on the mountain.
Then it was
found that part of
the limestone
pyramid which
forms the summit
of the greatest
mountain mass in
Europe had split
and fallen.</p>

<p>The avalanche
was one of the
biggest and most
destructive known
for some time.
The rock and ice
tumbling from
the summit dislodged
immense
snow fields, which
in turn tore out
rock, and the
great mass went
rumbling down
the mountainside
for nearly ten
miles. It plunged
along the glacier
bed, leaped the
valley of the
Doire, throwing
pine trees and
boulders about
like corks in a
waterfall, and
came to rest almost
miraculously
at the entrance
to the little Italian
village of
Pourtud. Several
houses, which
stood almost in
its path, were
spared by a width
of only a few
yards, and so far
no loss of life has
been reported.</p>

<h3>SHARK
FISHING IN
LOWER
CALIFORNIA</h3>


<p>The shark fishing
industry is
becoming increasingly
important
in the Ensenada
Consular district,
writes United
States Consul
William C. Burdett,
stationed in
Lower California.
The Lower California
shark,
known locally as
the dogfish shark,
is from four to
five feet long and
weighs from 90
to 125 pounds.
The fishing is usually
done by individual
fishermen
working out
from camps on
land. The fish are
caught on long
set lines, on
which are fifty to
one hundred
hooks baited with
small fish or
lumps of shark
meat.</p>

<p>The fins are
sold for consumption
by Chinese
in shark fin soup.
The liver is boiled
down and shark
oil rendered out.
Each liver gives
an average of one
gallon of oil. The
oil is used in
paints and as a
leather preservative.
The skins
are not utilized,
except for fertilizer.
Frequently
shark steaks are
sold by Chinese
in the district
under the name
of grayfish.</p>

<p>The large canneries
operating
fish fertilizer
plants in San
Diego, Cal., are
eager to buy
shark, and the
newly finished
plant at Sauzal,
Lower California,
expects to specialize
on converting
shark
into fish meal
fertilizer.</p>

ACID"
</b></p>

<p><b>
How the
"Inner
Mysteries"
Reveals Startling
Facts Overlooked
By Doctors and
Scientists For Centuries
</b></p>

<p>"I am eighty-three years old and I doctored
for rheumatism ever since I came out
of the army over fifty years ago" writes
J. B. Ashelman. "Like many others, I
spent money freely for so-called 'cures', and
I have read about 'Uric Acid' until I could
almost taste it. I could not sleep nights
or walk without pain; my hands were so
sore and stiff I could not hold a pen. But
now, as if by magic, I am again in active
business and can walk with ease or write all
day with comfort. Friends are surprised at
the change."</p>


<p class="center">HOW IT HAPPENED.</p>

<p>Mr. Ashelman is only one of thousands
who suffered for years, owing to the general
belief in the old, false theory that "Uric
Acid" causes rheumatism. This erroneous
belief induced him and legions of unfortunate
men and women to take wrong treatments.
You might just as well attempt to
put out a fire with oil as to try and get
rid of your rheumatism, neuritis and like
complaints, by taking treatments supposed
to drive Uric Acid out of your blood and
body. Many physicians and scientists now
know that Uric Acid never did, never can
and never will cause rheumatism; that it is
a natural and necessary constituent of the
blood; that it is found in every new-born
babe; and that without it we could not live!</p>

<p>These statements may seem strange to
some folks, who have all along been led to
believe in the old "Uric Acid" humbug. It
took Mr. Ashelman fifty years to find out
this truth. He learned how to get rid of
the true cause of his rheumatism, other
disorders, and recover his strength from
"The Inner Mysteries," a remarkable book
now being distributed free by an authority
who devoted over twenty years to the scientific
study of this particular trouble.</p>

<p>NOTE: If any reader of this magazine
wishes the book that reveals these facts regarding
the true cause and cure of rheumatism,
facts that were overlooked by doctors
and scientists for centuries past, simply
send a post card or letter to H. P. Clearwater,
No. 534 G Street. Hallowell, Maine,
and it will be sent by return mail without
any charge whatever. Cut out this notice
lest you forget! If not a sufferer yourself
hand this good news to some afflicted friend.</p>

<h3>SIGNS OF
GOLD VEIN
FRENCH
VILLAGE</h3>


<p>The peaceful
village life in
Coudray-Montceaux,
in the
Seine et Oise,
only half an
hour's ride by
train from Paris,
has been greatly
excited by the
discovery of
metal bearing
sand, the color of
which indicates a
gold vein, less
than twenty-five
feet below the
surface of the
ground. Samples
of the sand have
been sent to State
chemists, who refuse
to make any
comment until
the analyses are
completed. The
discovery was
made on the farm
of a retired Government
clerk
while drilling for
water.</p>

<p>Speculation in
adjoining properties,
however, has
already begun,
owners of the
land refusing offers
four times
the former value
of their property,
although as yet
they have nothing
definite to justify
the belief that a
new Klondike has
been discovered.
In fact, a reporter
succeeded in getting
a handful of
the sand, which
he brought back
to Paris. He was
assured by a
chemist after a
moment's examination
of it that
it was nothing
more than ferruginous
flakes
(fool's gold), similar
to the iron
pyrites which
early explorers
in America
brought to Europe
by shipload.&mdash;New
York Herald.</p>

<p>Added table of contents.</p>

<p>The title story of this issue originally appeared in <i>Fame and Fortune</i> #341. The
later reprint represented in this e-text contains some condensations (for example, the
first two chapters of the original version are combined into a single chapter here),
several chapter title variations, and the removal of many paragraph breaks.</p>

<p>Images may be clicked to view larger versions.</p>

<p>Retained some inconsistent hyphenation (e.g. suit-case vs. suitcases, to-day vs. today).</p>

<p>Retained some inconsistent spelling (e.g. Pittsburg vs. Pittsburgh).</p>

<p>Page 5, renumbered "The Missing Diamond" from Chapter V to Chapter IV.</p>

<p>Page 6, changed "Piont" to "Point" in Chapter V title.</p>

<p>Page 7, changed "attack it to" to "attach it to."</p>

<p>Page 8, changed "containing silverwire" to "containing silverware"
and "porprietor" to "proprietor."</p>

<p>Page 9, changed "wasd not very" to "was not very." Replaced misprinted
text "inventory of the loss showed that it was not very" (a duplication
of text lower on the page) with "their statement, for he knew exactly
what was in" (the correct text recovered from the earlier appearance in
<i>Fame and Fortune</i> #341).</p>

<p>Page 10, added missing quote after "him to wear."</p>

<p>Page 13, the last line of the column ("him, so Dick laid himself out to please her. He")
was accidentally duplicated between "Monday morning" and "eleven o'clock."
This duplicate text has been removed.</p>

<p>Page 16, changed "Fnish" to "Finish" in Chapter XI title.</p>

<p>Page 19, added missing "you" to "I'd like you to know."</p>

<p>Page 20, added missing quote after "BIG DEAL."</p>

<p>Page 21, changed "becomoing" to "becoming" in "becoming cinema stars."</p>

<p>Page 22, changed "consel" to "counsel," "plantiff" to "plaintiff" and
"objecions" to "objections."</p>

<p>Page 23, changed "rank any overpowering" to "rank and overpowering" and
"Foresrty" to "Forestry."</p>

<p>Page 24, the line "ing her, although Walden had uttered no threats" is
missing from this printing between "vague alarm concern-" and "against
her." The text has been filled in from a later reprint of the story, in
<i>Fame and Fortune</i> #828.</p>

<p>Changed "thatt villain, Walden" to "that villain, Walden."</p>

<p>Unnumbered pages, added missing quote after "usually the limit."
Added semi-colon after "Courtship." Changed
"In fact, a reporer" to "In fact, a reporter." The address
"438 West 63rd Street" is a best guess based on very blurry printing.</p>
